abstract: >
  A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on biostatistical
  power analysis and sample size calculation tasks, covering 106 validated
  tasks across 4 difficulty tiers from basic t-tests to advanced Riley
  prediction model calculations. Features LLM-as-judge evaluation with
  strict tolerance checking against R-validated ground truths.
