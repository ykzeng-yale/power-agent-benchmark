# Benchmark v2.2 - Strategy B: Claude-Generated Edition

**1,099 tasks** across 4 tiers, generated systematically from 17 R packages covering the full spectrum of power analysis and sample size calculations.

## Overview

This benchmark uses **Claude-generated tasks** that systematically cover functions across R power analysis packages. Each task was generated by extracting function signatures, creating realistic parameter combinations, and verifying ground truths via R execution.

## Tier Distribution

| Tier | Tasks | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Tier 1 | 259 | Basic comparisons (t-tests, ANOVA, proportions, chi-squared, correlation) |
| Tier 2 | 354 | Regression & models (linear/logistic/Poisson regression, survival, mediation, SEM) |
| Tier 3 | 375 | Complex designs (bioequivalence, group sequential, multilevel RCT, non-inferiority) |
| Tier 4 | 111 | Prediction & specialized (Riley prediction models, precision-based CI, diagnostic accuracy) |

## Key Characteristics

- Systematic coverage of 17 R packages
- All ground truths R-verified
- Broad function coverage per package
- Uniform task generation methodology

## Tolerance Rules

- **Deterministic** (pwr, pwrss, WebPower): max(1, ceil(0.02 * GT)) or max(0.005, 0.02 * val) for proportions
- **Iterative** (gsDesign, rpact, PowerTOST, TrialSize): max(2, ceil(0.05 * GT))
- **Simulation-based** (Superpower, simr): max(5, ceil(0.10 * GT))
