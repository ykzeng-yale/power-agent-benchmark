Here’s a standard **log-rank (Freedman) / proportional-hazards** sample-size calculation, then we translate “required events” into “required N” using your accrual + follow-up plan and a **20% dropout** assumption.

## 1) Convert 1-year control survival to a control hazard

Assume an exponential control survival curve (common for planning):

* (S_C(12\text{ mo}) = 0.70)
* (\lambda_C = -\ln(0.70)/12 = 0.0297) per month

Treatment hazard under (HR=0.75):

* (\lambda_T = 0.75\lambda_C = 0.0223) per month

## 2) Required number of events (log-rank)

For equal allocation, the required total number of events is

[
D ;=; \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{(\log HR)^2 , p(1-p)}
\quad\text{with } p=0.5
]

* Two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* Power (=0.85 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=1.036)
* (\log(HR)=\log(0.75)=-0.2877)
* (p(1-p)=0.25)

[
D \approx \frac{(1.96+1.036)^2}{(0.2877)^2 \cdot 0.25}
\approx 434 \text{ events}
]

## 3) Expected event probability given accrual + follow-up + dropout

Design: **18 months uniform accrual + 12 months additional follow-up**
So study ends at month (18+12=30). A subject enrolled at month (u\in[0,18]) is administratively followed for
[
t_{\text{admin}} = 30-u \in [12,30]\text{ months}.
]

To “account for 20% dropout”, a common planning model is **independent exponential dropout** with ~20% dropout by 12 months:
[
\mu = -\ln(0.80)/12 = 0.0186 \text{ per month}.
]

For a given administrative time (t), with event hazard (\lambda) and dropout hazard (\mu), the probability the **event occurs before dropout/admin censoring** is:
[
P(\text{event by }t)=\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu}\left(1-e^{-(\lambda+\mu)t}\right).
]

Averaging over uniform accrual (equivalently (t) uniform on ([12,30])) gives approximately:

* Control average event probability: (\bar p_C \approx 0.385)
* Treatment average event probability: (\bar p_T \approx 0.309)

Overall (1:1 randomization):
[
\bar p_{\text{event}} = (\bar p_C+\bar p_T)/2 \approx 0.347.
]

## 4) Convert required events to required sample size

[
N_{\text{total}}=\frac{D}{\bar p_{\text{event}}}
\approx \frac{434}{0.347} \approx 1251
]

So
[
N_{\text{per arm}} \approx 1251/2 \approx 625.5 ;\Rightarrow; \boxed{626 \text{ per arm}}
]

# Answer

**Plan for ~626 patients per arm (≈ 1,252 total)** to achieve **85% power** at **two-sided α = 0.05**, under:

* log-rank / PH assumption with (HR=0.75)
* exponential approximation calibrated to 70% 1-year control survival
* 18 mo uniform accrual + 12 mo additional follow-up
* dropout modeled as ~20% by 12 months (independent exponential censoring)

If your “20% dropout” instead means **20% lost by study end regardless of follow-up time**, a conservative shortcut is to inflate a no-dropout N by (1/0.8), which would typically land a bit higher than 626/arm.
