For a (stratified) log-rank / Cox PH design with a **common treatment HR across strata**, the power is driven primarily by the **total number of events** (stratification mainly protects against baseline-hazard differences; it doesn’t materially change the required *total* events when HR is constant).

## 1) Required total number of events (Schoenfeld / log-rank)

With equal allocation (50/50), the required number of events is

[
D ;=; \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{{\log(HR)}^2 , p(1-p)}
]
where (p=0.5).

* Two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* Power (=0.80 \Rightarrow \beta=0.20 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=0.84)
* (HR=0.75 \Rightarrow \log(HR)=\log(0.75)=-0.2877)
* (p(1-p)=0.25)

Compute:

* ((1.96+0.84)^2 = 2.80^2 \approx 7.85)
* ((\log 0.75)^2 \approx 0.2877^2 \approx 0.0828)
* Denominator (= 0.0828 \times 0.25 = 0.0207)

[
D \approx \frac{7.85}{0.0207} \approx 379 \text{ events total}
]

## 2) Convert events → sample size using expected 2-year event probabilities

You gave: **2-year control event risk = 40%**, so (S_C(2)=0.60).

Under proportional hazards, survival in treatment at 2 years is approximately:
[
S_T(2) = S_C(2)^{HR} = 0.60^{0.75} \approx 0.682
]
So treatment event risk:
[
\Pr(\text{event}|T) = 1 - 0.682 \approx 0.318
]

Average event proportion across both arms (equal allocation):
[
\bar{q} = (0.40 + 0.318)/2 \approx 0.359
]

Thus total sample size:
[
N \approx D / \bar{q} \approx 379 / 0.359 \approx 1057
]
So per arm:
[
N/2 \approx 528.5 ;\Rightarrow; \boxed{529 \text{ per arm}}
]

## Result

**Sample size ≈ 529 participants per arm (≈ 1,058 total)** for 80% power at two-sided α = 0.05, assuming:

* common HR = 0.75 across strata,
* 2-year control event probability 40%,
* equal randomization and follow-up sufficient so those event rates are realized.

If you expect dropout / non-adherence / less-than-2y follow-up, you’d inflate this by (1/(1-\text{attrition})).
