We can treat this as a **2×2 comparison of two proportions** with **unequal group sizes** because exposure prevalence is 30% (exposed) vs 70% (unexposed). The “baseline risk 5%” is naturally interpreted as the **event risk in the unexposed** group.

## 1) Convert the OR to an exposed event risk

Let

* (p_0 = P(Y=1\mid X=0)=0.05) (unexposed risk)
* OR (=2.5)

Then the exposed risk is
[
p_1=\frac{\text{OR}\cdot p_0}{1-p_0+\text{OR}\cdot p_0}
=\frac{2.5\cdot 0.05}{0.95+2.5\cdot 0.05}
=\frac{0.125}{1.075}
\approx 0.1163
]
So you’re comparing **5.0% vs 11.6%** (risk difference (d = p_1-p_0 \approx 0.0663)).

Exposure prevalence implies allocation:
[
n_1 = 0.30N,\quad n_0 = 0.70N,\quad r=\frac{n_1}{n_0}=\frac{0.30}{0.70}\approx 0.4286
]

## 2) Sample size formula (two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (=0.80))

Using the standard normal-approximation formula for two independent proportions with ratio (r=n_1/n_0):

* (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta}=0.84)

Weighted overall event rate under the alternative:
[
\bar p=\frac{p_1 r + p_0}{1+r}
]

Then
[
n_1
===

\frac{\left[
z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{\bar p(1-\bar p)\left(1+\frac{1}{r}\right)}
+
z_{1-\beta}\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)+\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{r}}
\right]^2}{(p_1-p_0)^2}
,\quad
n_0=\frac{n_1}{r}
]

Plugging in (p_0=0.05,\ p_1\approx0.1163,\ r\approx0.4286) gives approximately:

* **Exposed:** (n_1 \approx 386)
* **Unexposed:** (n_0 \approx 900)
* **Total:** (N \approx 1286)

## Answer

**You need about (\boxed{N \approx 1{,}286}) total participants** for 80% power at (\alpha=0.05) (two-sided), given 30% exposed.

That corresponds to roughly **386 exposed** and **900 unexposed**.

## Practical notes (why your final N might be a bit higher)

* If you use **continuity correction**, exact methods, or want cushion for model-based analysis, the required N often increases a bit (commonly a few percent).
* If there’s **loss to follow-up**, inflate: (N_\text{target} = N/(1-\text{dropout})). For example, 10% dropout ⇒ (1286/0.90 \approx 1429).

If your “5% baseline risk” actually refers to the **overall** event rate (not unexposed), tell me and I’ll recompute—this changes (p_0) and thus the required N.
