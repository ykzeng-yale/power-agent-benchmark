Assuming this is a **cluster-randomized trial** (clinics assigned to treatment vs control; patients nested within clinic), the **number of clinics (10/arm)** is what mainly drives power. Increasing patients/clinic helps, but with ICC>0 there’s a hard ceiling.

## Step 1) Work on the cluster-mean scale

Let individual outcome SD be ( \sigma ). You gave a standardized effect (d=\Delta/\sigma=0.3).

With **clinic size (m)** and **ICC ( \rho=0.05)**, the SD of a **clinic mean** is:

[
\mathrm{SD}(\bar Y_{\text{clinic}})=
\sigma\sqrt{\rho+\frac{1-\rho}{m}}
=\sigma\sqrt{\frac{1+(m-1)\rho}{m}}
]

So the **standardized effect size among clinic means** is

[
d_{\text{clinic}}=\frac{\Delta}{\mathrm{SD}(\bar Y_{\text{clinic}})}
= d\sqrt{\frac{m}{1+(m-1)\rho}}
]

## Step 2) Power for a 2-sample t-test on 10 clinic means per arm

With (J=10) clinics/arm, df (\approx 2J-2=18). For a two-sided (\alpha=0.05):

[
t_{0.975,18}\approx 2.101
]

Noncentrality parameter for the 2-sample t-test is

[
\text{ncp} = d_{\text{clinic}}\sqrt{\frac{J}{2}}
]

We choose (m) so that
[
\Pr\left(\left|T_{18,\text{ncp}}\right|>t_{0.975,18}\right)=0.80.
]

Solving this gives:

## Result

**You need about (\boxed{m \approx 750}) patients per clinic** (so **~7,500 patients per arm**, **15,000 total**).

### Why it’s so large

As (m\to\infty), the best you can do is:

[
d_{\text{clinic,max}} = d\sqrt{\frac{1}{\rho}}
=0.3\sqrt{20}\approx 1.34,
\quad
\text{ncp}_{\max}=1.34\sqrt{\frac{10}{2}} \approx 3.0
]

With df=18 and two-sided (\alpha=0.05), that corresponds to **max power only ~0.81**, so **80% is barely achievable** and only when (m) is very large.

### Practical takeaway

If recruiting 750/clinic is unrealistic, the clean fix is **more clinics** (even modest increases in # clinics often beat huge increases in patients/clinic when ICC>0).

If you tell me whether randomization is truly **at the clinic level** (vs individually randomized within clinic), I can recompute—individual randomization changes the answer a lot.
