Because you’re measuring the **same participants before vs after**, this is a **paired (one-sample on the change scores)** problem.

### 1) Set up the effect on the change scores

* Mean change you want to detect: (\Delta = 3) kg (loss)
* SD of the change scores: (\sigma_d = 5) kg
* Standardized effect on the change scores:
  [
  d = \frac{\Delta}{\sigma_d} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
  ]

### 2) Sample size formula (approx, paired t ≈ z)

For a **two-sided** test with (\alpha = 0.05) and power (1-\beta = 0.90):
[
n \approx \left(\frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta})\ \sigma_d}{\Delta}\right)^2
]
Critical values:

* (z_{1-\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \approx 1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.90} \approx 1.2816)

Plug in:
[
n \approx \left(\frac{(1.96+1.2816)\cdot 5}{3}\right)^2
= \left(\frac{3.2416\cdot 5}{3}\right)^2
= \left(5.4027\right)^2
\approx 29.2
]

### 3) Round up

You can’t enroll 29.2 people, so:
[
\boxed{n = 30\ \text{participants}}
]

### Practical note (dropout)

If you expect dropout, inflate:
[
n_{\text{enroll}}=\frac{30}{1-\text{dropout rate}}
]

* 10% dropout → (30/0.9 = 33.3) → **34**
* 20% dropout → (30/0.8 = 37.5) → **38**

So the core answer is **30 completers** (and likely **~34–38 enrolled** depending on attrition).
