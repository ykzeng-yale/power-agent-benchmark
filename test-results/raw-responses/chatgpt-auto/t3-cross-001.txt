For a standard **2×2 crossover** with a continuous outcome, the primary treatment comparison is essentially a **within-subject (paired) comparison**. The within-subject correlation reduces the variance of the treatment difference.

### 1) Convert the “between-subject” effect size to the paired (within-subject) effect size

Let:

* (d = \Delta/\sigma = 0.5) (effect size using the **between-subject SD** (\sigma))
* (\rho = 0.7) (within-subject correlation)

For a paired difference, the SD of the within-subject difference is:
[
\sigma_D = \sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(Y_A-Y_B)} = \sqrt{2\sigma^2(1-\rho)} = \sigma\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}
]

So the **paired** standardized effect size is:
[
d_{\text{paired}}=\frac{\Delta}{\sigma_D}=\frac{\Delta/\sigma}{\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}}=\frac{d}{\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}}
]

Plug in:
[
d_{\text{paired}}=\frac{0.5}{\sqrt{2(1-0.7)}}=\frac{0.5}{\sqrt{0.6}} \approx \frac{0.5}{0.7746}\approx 0.6455
]

### 2) Paired t-test sample size (normal approximation)

Two-sided (\alpha=0.05\Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)

Power (=0.80\Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=0.84)

Approximate required number of subjects:
[
n \approx \left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{d_{\text{paired}}}\right)^2
= \left(\frac{1.96+0.84}{0.6455}\right)^2
= \left(\frac{2.80}{0.6455}\right)^2
\approx (4.34)^2 \approx 18.8
]

So you need **~19 subjects total**.

### 3) Make it a proper 2×2 crossover with equal sequences

In a 2×2 crossover you typically randomize equally to **AB** vs **BA**, so round up to an even number:

✅ **Answer: 20 subjects total** (≈ **10 per sequence**) for ~80% power at (\alpha=0.05).

**Notes (practical):**

* This assumes no major carryover issues and that the treatment effect is estimated primarily from within-subject differences (the usual efficiency advantage of crossover).
* If you expect dropout, inflate: e.g., 10% dropout → (20/0.9 \approx 22.2) → **24 total** is a common planning number.
