In a balanced **2×2 factorial** with **n subjects per cell**, each *main effect* compares the two **marginal means**:

* Level A0 mean = average of two cells → based on **2n** subjects
* Level A1 mean = average of two cells → based on **2n** subjects

So detecting the main effect of factor A with standardized effect **d = 0.4** is essentially the same as a **two-sample comparison** with **n₁ = n₂ = 2n**.

For a two-sided test at **α = 0.05** and **80% power**:

[
n_{\text{per level}} ;=; \frac{2,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{d^2}
]

With (z_{0.975}=1.96) and (z_{0.8}=0.842):

[
n_{\text{per level}} \approx \frac{2,(1.96+0.842)^2}{0.4^2}
= \frac{2,(2.802)^2}{0.16}
\approx \frac{2\cdot 7.85}{0.16}
\approx 98.1
]

So you need about **99 subjects per factor level** (marginal group). Since each level has **2n** subjects:

[
2n \ge 99 ;\Rightarrow; n \ge 49.5
]

✅ **Answer: 50 subjects per cell** (total (4\times 50 = 200)).

*(This is the usual planning number when you’re powering a main effect and assuming a balanced design; strong interaction could reduce interpretability of the main effect, but it doesn’t change this algebra for the contrast’s SE.)*
