Assuming **treatment is assigned at the site level** (because you have *5 sites per treatment arm*), the treatment effect is estimated from **between-site** information, with precision driven by the number of sites and the variance of each site’s mean.

### 1) Variance of a site mean (averaging over patients and repeated measures)

Let

* (m = 15) patients per site
* (r = 3) measurements per patient
* Variance components (total = 1):

  * site: (\sigma^2_{\text{site}} = 0.02)
  * patient (within site): (\sigma^2_{\text{pat}} = 0.50)
  * residual (within patient): (\sigma^2_e = 0.48)

A **site mean** averages across (m) patients and (m r) observations, so:

[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar{Y}*{\text{site}})=
\sigma^2*{\text{site}} + \frac{\sigma^2_{\text{pat}}}{m} + \frac{\sigma^2_e}{m r}
]

Plug in:

[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar{Y}_{\text{site}})
=0.02 + \frac{0.50}{15} + \frac{0.48}{45}
=0.02 + 0.03333 + 0.01067
=0.064
]

So (\text{SD}(\bar{Y}_{\text{site}})=\sqrt{0.064}=0.253).

### 2) Standard error for the treatment contrast (5 sites per arm)

With (k=5) sites per arm, the arm mean is the average of 5 site means:

[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar{Y}_{\text{arm}})=\frac{0.064}{5}=0.0128
]

Difference of two independent arm means:

[
\mathrm{Var}(\Delta)=2\cdot \frac{0.064}{5}=0.0256
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\mathrm{SE}(\Delta)=\sqrt{0.0256}=0.16
]

### 3) Effect size and power

You want to detect (d=0.4). Since total SD = 1, the raw mean difference is:

[
\Delta = 0.4
]

Noncentrality:

[
\lambda = \frac{\Delta}{\mathrm{SE}}=\frac{0.4}{0.16}=2.5
]

Using a **two-sided (\alpha=0.05)** test with **cluster-level degrees of freedom**
(\text{df} \approx 2k-2 = 8),

the resulting power is:

[
\textbf{Power} \approx \mathbf{0.59} ; (\textbf{about 59%})
]

## Answer

**This design achieves ~59% power (two-sided (\alpha=0.05)) to detect (d=0.4)**, under a site-randomized analysis (df ≈ 8) using the given variance components and equal cluster sizes.
