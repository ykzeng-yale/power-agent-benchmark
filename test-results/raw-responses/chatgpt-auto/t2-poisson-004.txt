You can treat this as a **two‐group Poisson rate comparison** (e.g., log rate ratio test), where each subject contributes an “exposure time” (t_i).

### 1) Convert inputs to expected events per subject

* Mean follow-up: (\mu_t = 0.8) years (SD (=0.3))
* Baseline rate: (\lambda_0 = 3) events/year
* Target rate ratio: (RR = 1.4 \Rightarrow \lambda_1 = 4.2) events/year

Expected events per subject:
[
\mu_0=\lambda_0\mu_t=3(0.8)=2.4,\quad
\mu_1=\lambda_1\mu_t=4.2(0.8)=3.36
]

### 2) “Plain Poisson” sample size (uses mean follow-up only)

For equal (n) per group, an approximate variance for (\log(\widehat{RR})) is
[
\mathrm{Var}(\log \widehat{RR}) \approx \frac{1}{n\mu_1}+\frac{1}{n\mu_0}
]
Required:
[
\frac{|\log(RR)|}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}}} \ge z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}
]
With (\alpha=0.05) (two-sided) and 80% power: (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96,\ z_{1-\beta}=0.84).

So
[
n \ge \frac{(1.96+0.84)^2\left(\frac{1}{\mu_1}+\frac{1}{\mu_0}\right)}{(\log 1.4)^2}
\approx 49.5
]
**Plain Poisson answer: (\boxed{50\text{ subjects per group}})** (total (\approx 100)).

## 3) Adjusting for variable follow-up time (uses the SD = 0.3 years)

If follow-up time varies across patients, the marginal count variance is inflated (a mild **overdispersion**) because (\lambda t_i) varies across subjects. A simple planning approximation is:
[
\phi \approx 1+\frac{\lambda,\mathrm{Var}(t)}{E(t)}
]
Here (\mathrm{Var}(t)=0.3^2=0.09).

* Control:
  [
  \phi_0 = 1+\frac{3(0.09)}{0.8}=1.3375
  ]
* Treatment:
  [
  \phi_1 = 1+\frac{4.2(0.09)}{0.8}=1.4725
  ]

Then inflate the variance:
[
\mathrm{Var}(\log \widehat{RR}) \approx \frac{\phi_1}{n\mu_1}+\frac{\phi_0}{n\mu_0}
]
which gives
[
n \approx 69.0
]
**Follow-up variability–adjusted answer: (\boxed{70\text{ subjects per group}})** (total (\approx 140)).

### Recommendation

* If you expect counts to behave close to Poisson and follow-up variability isn’t driving extra heterogeneity: **~50/group**.
* If you want to explicitly account for the reported follow-up SD (often a good idea): **~70/group**.

If you also expect **additional overdispersion** beyond follow-up variability (common in clinical count outcomes), you’d increase (n) further by that extra dispersion factor.
