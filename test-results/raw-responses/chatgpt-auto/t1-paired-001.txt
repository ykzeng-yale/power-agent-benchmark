Because this is **before/after on the same patients**, the usual analysis is a **paired t-test** (equivalently, a one-sample test on the *change scores*).

### 1) Set up in terms of change scores

Let (\Delta_i = \text{(post)}_i - \text{(pre)}_i).

You expect an average improvement of **5 points**, with **SD of the changes = 10**.

So the standardized mean change (Cohen’s (d) for the change scores) is:
[
d=\frac{\mu_\Delta}{\sigma_\Delta}=\frac{5}{10}=0.5
]

### 2) Sample size formula (normal approximation)

For a two-sided test with (\alpha=0.05) and power (1-\beta=0.80):
[
n \approx \left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{d}\right)^2
]
Here:

* (z_{1-\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \approx 1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.80} \approx 0.84)

Plug in:
[
n \approx \left(\frac{1.96+0.84}{0.5}\right)^2
= \left(\frac{2.80}{0.5}\right)^2
= (5.6)^2
= 31.36
]

### 3) Round up

You need an integer number of patients, so:
[
n = 32 \text{ patients}
]

### Practical note

Because the paired **t** test (not z) is used in practice, some planners add a tiny cushion; you might target **33–34**. But the standard calculation lands at **32 patients** (with complete pre/post data).
