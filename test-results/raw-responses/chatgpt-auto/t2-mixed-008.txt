Because you’re **only powering the primary outcome** (no multiplicity) the **cross‐outcome correlation (0.6)** doesn’t affect the usual sample size calculation *unless* you planned to fit a joint multivariate model and borrow strength across outcomes. For a standard mixed model / repeated-measures analysis of the **primary outcome alone**, you can ignore that 0.6.

### 1) Start with the 2-sample “single time point” requirement

For a continuous outcome with standardized effect size (d), equal allocation, two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (1-\beta=0.80):

[
n_{\text{per group, single}} ;=; \frac{2,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{d^2}
]

* (z_{1-\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \approx 1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.80} \approx 0.84)
* (d = 0.4)

[
n_{\text{single}} = \frac{2,(1.96+0.84)^2}{0.4^2}
= \frac{2,(2.80)^2}{0.16}
= \frac{2\cdot 7.84}{0.16}
= \frac{15.68}{0.16}
= 98
]

So with **one measurement**, you’d need **~98 per group**.

### 2) Credit for 3 repeated measures with ICC = 0.5 (compound symmetry)

With (m) repeated measures per subject and within-subject correlation (\rho) (ICC under CS), the efficiency gain for estimating a *constant* group difference using all time points is approximately:

[
\text{Information multiplier} ;=; \frac{m}{1+(m-1)\rho}
]

Here (m=3), (\rho=0.5):

[
\frac{3}{1+2(0.5)}=\frac{3}{2}=1.5
]

That means 3 correlated measures give you about **1.5×** the information of a single measure.

So divide the single-time-point sample size by 1.5:

[
n_{\text{per group}} \approx \frac{98}{1.5} \approx 65.3 ;\Rightarrow; 66
]

## Answer

**≈ 66 subjects per group** (≈ **132 total**) for **80% power** at **two-sided (\alpha=0.05)** for the **primary outcome**, with **3 time points** and **ICC = 0.5**.

*Rule-of-thumb note:* if you expect attrition/missing visits, inflate (66) by (1/(1-\text{dropout})) (e.g., 15% dropout → (66/0.85 \approx 78) per group).
