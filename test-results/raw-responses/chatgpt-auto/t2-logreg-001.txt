You can treat this as a **2-group comparison of proportions** (which is equivalent to a logistic regression with a single binary predictor), because exposure prevalence is 50% ⇒ roughly **equal group sizes**.

## 1) Convert the odds ratio to an exposed risk

Given unexposed risk (p_0 = 0.20) and expected odds ratio (OR=2.0),

[
p_1 ;=; \frac{OR\cdot p_0}{1-p_0 + OR\cdot p_0}
;=;
\frac{2(0.20)}{0.80 + 2(0.20)}
==============================

# \frac{0.40}{1.20}

0.3333
]

So you expect **33.3%** disease in exposed vs **20%** in unexposed.

Risk difference:
[
\Delta = p_1 - p_0 = 0.3333 - 0.20 = 0.1333
]

## 2) Two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (=0.80)

Critical values:

* (z_{1-\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} = 1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.80} = 0.842)

With equal group sizes, a common large-sample formula is:

[
n_{\text{per group}} =
\frac{\left[
z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{2\bar p(1-\bar p)} ;+;
z_{1-\beta}\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)+p_1(1-p_1)}
\right]^2}{(p_1-p_0)^2}
]
where (\bar p=(p_0+p_1)/2).

Compute pieces:

* (\bar p = (0.20+0.3333)/2 = 0.2667)
* (\sqrt{2\bar p(1-\bar p)} = \sqrt{2(0.2667)(0.7333)} \approx 0.625)
* (\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)+p_1(1-p_1)}=\sqrt{0.2\cdot0.8 + 0.3333\cdot0.6667}\approx 0.617)

So:
[
n_{\text{per group}} \approx
\frac{(1.96\cdot0.625 + 0.842\cdot0.617)^2}{0.1333^2}
\approx \frac{(1.225 + 0.519)^2}{0.01778}
\approx \frac{3.04}{0.01778}
\approx 171.5
]

Round up ⇒ **172 per group**.

## 3) Total sample size

Because exposure prevalence is 50% (≈ equal groups):

[
N_{\text{total}} \approx 2\times 172 = \mathbf{344}
]

### Quick sanity check (events)

Overall event rate (\approx (0.20+0.3333)/2 = 0.2667).
Expected events (\approx 0.2667 \times 344 \approx 92) total events.

## Practical note

* If you plan **covariate adjustment**, missing data, or imbalance away from 50/50 exposure, you’ll typically want **more than 344**.
* A continuity-corrected or exact approach often bumps this up a bit (think “mid/high 300s”), but the standard planning number from the usual normal approximation is **~344 total**.
