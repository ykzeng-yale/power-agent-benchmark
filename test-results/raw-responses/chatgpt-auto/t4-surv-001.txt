Using the **Riley et al. (Part II) minimum sample size framework** for **time-to-event (Cox) prediction models** (3 criteria: shrinkage ≥0.90, optimism in R² ≤0.05, and precise estimation of the average risk at the prediction timepoint), your inputs **match their worked VTE recurrence example**: **30 predictor parameters**, **Cox–Snell R² = 0.051**, **event rate = 0.065 per person-year**, **mean follow-up = 2.07 years**, **prediction timepoint = 2 years**. ([RCA Storage][1])

### Minimum required sample size

* **Minimum total sample size (N): 4,286 participants** ([RCA Storage][1])
* This corresponds to expected total follow-up of

  * **Person-years ≈ 4,286 × 2.07 = 8,872** ([RCA Storage][1])
* Expected number of outcome events:

  * **Events ≈ 8,872 × 0.065 ≈ 577** ([RCA Storage][1])
* Events per predictor parameter:

  * **EPP ≈ 577 / 25 ≈ 23** (as reported in the example; their “p” in that example corresponds to 25 parameters in the final calculation, even though 30 candidates were considered) ([RCA Storage][1])

### Interpretation / assumptions baked into this number

* The **4,286** is driven by **criterion (i)** (target global shrinkage ≥0.90), and it was the **largest** of the three criteria in the example, so it becomes the **minimum recommended N**. ([RCA Storage][1])
* For the “risk at 2 years” precision check, they assume a **simple exponential model** to map the **rate (0.065 per person-year)** to **2-year cumulative incidence**:

  * (F(2)=1-\exp(-0.065\times 2)=0.122). ([RCA Storage][1])
    With N=4,286 the resulting CI width easily meets the ±0.05 target in that worked example. ([RCA Storage][1])

**Bottom line:** plan for **at least ~4,286 participants** (≈ **577 events expected**) to develop the recurrent VTE survival prediction model under these assumptions.
