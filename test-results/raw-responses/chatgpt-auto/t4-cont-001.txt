**Minimum sample size: 918 children** (for 25 candidate predictor parameters and anticipated **R² = 0.20**).

This comes from the *Riley et al.* / **pmsampsize** approach for continuous outcomes, which takes the **maximum** sample size required across several criteria (to control overfitting and ensure adequate precision). ([CRAN][1])

### How the 918 is determined (key criteria)

Using your inputs (**parameters p = 25**, **R² = 0.20**, intercept/mean **= 1.9**, outcome SD **= 0.6**, default target shrinkage **S = 0.90**, default intercept precision setting **MMOE = 1.1**):

1. **Criterion 1: small overfitting (global shrinkage ≥ 0.90)**
   This is the binding one here. The pmsampsize continuous-outcome formula iterates over *n* until the expected shrinkage reaches 0.90, which happens at **n₁ = 918**. ([R Documentation][2])

2. **Criterion 2: small optimism in R² (apparent − adjusted ≤ 0.05)**
   This gives **n₂ = 401**. ([R Documentation][2])

3. **Criterion 3: precise residual SD**
   This gives **n₃ = 234 + p = 259**. ([R Documentation][2])

4. **Criterion 4: precise estimation of the intercept (mean outcome)**
   This uses your intercept (= mean) and SD, but since it starts from max(n₁, n₂, n₃) and checks precision, it does **not** increase beyond 918 here (MMOE achieved at n = 918). ([R Documentation][2])

### Final

Take the maximum:
[
n_{\min}=\max(n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4)=\max(918,401,259,918)=\mathbf{918}.
]

That corresponds to **SPP = n/p = 918/25 = 36.72 subjects per predictor parameter**. ([R Documentation][2])
