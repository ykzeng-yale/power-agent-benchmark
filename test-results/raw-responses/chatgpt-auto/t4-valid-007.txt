To size a **validation** study for a target **95% CI width** of the **C-statistic (AUC)**, a common planning approach is to use the large-sample (Wald-type) CI

[
\text{AUC} \pm z_{0.975},SE(\text{AUC})
]

So the **total CI width** is approximately

[
\text{Width} \approx 2 z_{0.975} SE(\text{AUC})
]

You want Width ≤ 0.10, so the required standard error is

[
SE(\text{AUC}) \le \frac{0.10}{2\times 1.96}=\frac{0.05}{1.96}\approx 0.02551
]

## Step 1: Use an AUC variance formula

A widely used planning variance is the **Hanley & McNeil** approximation:

[
\mathrm{Var}(\text{AUC})=
\frac{
A(1-A) + (n_1-1)(Q_1-A^2) + (n_0-1)(Q_2-A^2)
}{
n_1 n_0
}
]

where

* (A) = expected AUC (here **0.75**)
* (n_1) = number of **events/cases**
* (n_0) = number of **non-events/controls**
* (Q_1 = \frac{A}{2-A}), (Q_2 = \frac{2A^2}{1+A})

Compute (Q_1, Q_2) at (A=0.75):

[
Q_1=\frac{0.75}{1.25}=0.60,\quad
Q_2=\frac{2(0.75)^2}{1.75}=\frac{1.125}{1.75}\approx 0.642857
]

## Step 2: Link to prevalence

Prevalence is 12%, so for total (N):

[
n_1 \approx 0.12N,\qquad n_0 \approx 0.88N
]

For sample size planning we choose integers; a conservative way is:
[
n_1 = \lceil 0.12N\rceil,\quad n_0=N-n_1
]

---

## Step 3: Solve for N

We need

[
2\times 1.96 \times \sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(\text{AUC})} \le 0.10
]

Plugging in (A=0.75) and searching over (N) (with integer (n_1,n_0) as above), the **smallest N** that achieves width ≤ 0.10 is:

* **Total (N = 1092)**
* Expected events (n_1 = \lceil 0.12\times 1092\rceil = 132)
* Non-events (n_0 = 960)

This yields an approximate 95% CI width of **~0.0998**, meeting your ≤0.10 requirement.

## Answer

**You need about *N = 1,092* patients total** (about **132 events** and **960 non-events**) to have a planned **95% CI width for the C-statistic ≤ 0.10**, assuming an expected AUC of **0.75** and outcome prevalence **12%**.

If you want, I can also show how the required N changes if (a) you use a DeLong-based SE instead of Hanley–McNeil, or (b) you plan for some missing outcomes / loss to follow-up (usually inflate N by dividing by expected usable fraction).
