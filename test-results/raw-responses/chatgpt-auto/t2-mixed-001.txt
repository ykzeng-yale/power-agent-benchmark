Here’s a clean way to approximate this for a **2-arm longitudinal study** when your primary estimand is a **constant (time-averaged) treatment effect** across the 4 repeated measures.

## 1) Start from the “no repeats” two-sample mean comparison

You gave **Cohen’s d = 0.5** (difference in group means divided by the *SD of a single measurement*).
For a two-sided test with **α = 0.05** and **80% power**:

[
n_0 ;=; \frac{2,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{d^2}
]

* (z_{1-\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \approx 1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.80} \approx 0.84)

Compute:

[
n_0 = \frac{2(1.96+0.84)^2}{0.5^2}
= \frac{2(2.80)^2}{0.25}
= \frac{2\cdot 7.84}{0.25}
= \frac{15.68}{0.25}
= 62.72
]

So with **one measurement per subject**, you’d need about:

[
n_0 \approx 63 \text{ per group}
]

## 2) Credit the efficiency gain from 4 repeated measures with ICC = 0.5

If the treatment effect is roughly the same at each timepoint and you’re essentially estimating a **group difference in the average level over time**, then averaging the (m) repeated measures reduces variance by:

[
\text{Var}(\bar{Y}) = \sigma^2 \cdot \frac{1+(m-1)\rho}{m}
]

where:

* (m = 4) repeated measures
* (\rho = \text{ICC} = 0.5)

So the “variance inflation/deflation” factor relative to a single observation is:

[
\frac{1+(m-1)\rho}{m}
= \frac{1 + 3(0.5)}{4}
= \frac{1+1.5}{4}
= \frac{2.5}{4}
= 0.625
]

That means the repeated measures give you the same information as if you had multiplied your sample size by (1/0.625 = 1.6). Equivalently, required (n) per group is reduced to:

[
n ;=; n_0 \times 0.625
= 63 \times 0.625
= 39.375
]

## Result

**≈ 40 subjects per group** (so **≈ 80 total**) for **80% power at α = 0.05 (two-sided)**.

## Practical note (you almost always inflate)

Longitudinal studies commonly lose power due to dropout/missing visits. If you expect, say:

* **10% attrition**: (40 / 0.90 \approx 45) per group
* **20% attrition**: (40 / 0.80 = 50) per group

## When this shortcut can be wrong (directionally)

* If the key hypothesis is a **group × time interaction** (different slopes), you’ll often need **more** than this.
* If ICC is **higher**, repeated measures help **less**; if ICC is **lower**, they help **more**.

If you tell me whether your primary test is **(A) overall mean difference averaged over time** or **(B) difference in change/slope (interaction)**, I can tailor the calculation to the exact estimand.
