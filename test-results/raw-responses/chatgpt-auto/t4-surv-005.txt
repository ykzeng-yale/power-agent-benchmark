Using the **Riley et al. minimum sample size framework for time-to-event (Cox) prediction models**, the usual “minimum N” is the **largest** sample size required across 3 criteria, with the most common driver being **criterion (i): target global shrinkage (eg, 0.90)**. ([RCA Storage][1])

## Given

* Candidate predictor parameters: **p = 15**
* Anticipated model performance: **R²_CS = 0.20** (Cox–Snell, optimism-adjusted / expected in new data)
* Target shrinkage: **S = 0.90** (default recommendation in the framework) ([RCA Storage][1])
* 3-year event risk ≈ **40%**, mean follow-up **2.5 years** (used mainly for criterion iii, not needed for criterion i) ([CRAN][2])

## Criterion (i): shrinkage ≥ 0.90 → required total N

Riley et al. give the closed-form solution (their Eq. 11): ([RCA Storage][1])

[
n ;=; \frac{p}{(S-1),\ln\left(1-\frac{R^2_{CS}}{S}\right)}
]

Plug in (p=15), (S=0.9), (R^2_{CS}=0.20):

* (1-\frac{0.20}{0.9}=1-0.2222=0.7778)
* (\ln(0.7778)\approx -0.2513)
* ((S-1)\ln(\cdot)=(-0.1)\times(-0.2513)=0.02513)
* (n = 15 / 0.02513 \approx 596.9)

✅ **Minimum sample size ≈ 597 participants (round up to 600).**

## What that implies in events (sanity check)

If the **3-year cumulative incidence is truly 40%**, expected events by 3 years:

* (E \approx 0.40 \times 597 \approx 239) events
* Events per predictor parameter (EPP) (\approx 239/15 \approx 15.9)

If the **mean follow-up is only 2.5 years**, the *observed* event fraction by study end may be lower than 0.40 (depending on censoring), so observed events could be fewer—but the **minimum-N calculation above is already driven by (R^2_{CS}) and shrinkage**, not a blanket EPP rule. ([RCA Storage][1])

## Bottom line

**Plan for at least ~600 participants total** to develop the survival prediction model under the Riley/pmsampsize criteria with **p=15** and **R²_CS=0.20** (targeting shrinkage 0.90). ([RCA Storage][1])

If you want, I can also compute the **criterion (iii)** requirement explicitly using your follow-up/censoring assumptions (it’s usually smaller than ~600 when the event risk is ~40%, but we can verify).
