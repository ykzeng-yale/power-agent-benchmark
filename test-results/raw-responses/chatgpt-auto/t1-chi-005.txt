For a chi-square **goodness-of-fit** test with **5 categories**, the degrees of freedom are

* (df = k-1 = 5-1 = 4).

Cohen’s (w) for GOF ties to the chi-square statistic via
[
\chi^2 \approx N w^2,
]
and under the alternative the test statistic is well-approximated by a **noncentral chi-square** distribution with

* noncentrality (\lambda = N w^2),
* (df=4).

### Step 1) Critical value (alpha = 0.05)

Reject for large values, so the cutoff is the 95th percentile of (\chi^2_4):
[
c = \chi^2_{0.95,4} \approx 9.488.
]

### Step 2) Power equation

Power is
[
\text{Power} = P\left(\chi^2_{df=4,\ \lambda} > c\right)
= 1 - F_{\chi^2}(c;\ df=4,\ \lambda),
]
with (\lambda = N w^2 = N(0.35^2)=N(0.1225)).

We need this to be **0.85**, i.e.
[
1 - F_{\chi^2}(9.488;\ 4,\ N\cdot 0.1225) = 0.85.
]

### Step 3) Solve for (N)

Numerically, the smallest (N) that achieves at least 85% power is:

* (N=108 \Rightarrow) power (\approx 0.844) (a bit low)
* **(N=110 \Rightarrow) power (\approx 0.852)** (meets target)
* (N=112 \Rightarrow) power (\approx 0.859)

✅ **Answer: You need a total sample size of about (\mathbf{N=110})** (total count across the 5 categories).

If you want a tiny safety margin for discreteness / rounding, use **(N=112)**.
