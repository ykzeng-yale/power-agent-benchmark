With a **cluster randomized** (school-based) design, the key penalty is the **design effect** from the ICC.

### 1) Design effect and effective sample size

* Schools per arm: (J = 15)
* Students per school: (m = 30)
* ICC: (\rho = 0.08)
* Students per arm: (n = Jm = 15 \times 30 = 450)

Design effect (equal cluster sizes):
[
DE = 1 + (m-1)\rho = 1 + 29(0.08) = 3.32
]

Effective sample size per arm:
[
n_{\text{eff}} = \frac{n}{DE} = \frac{450}{3.32} \approx 135.54
]

### 2) Minimum detectable effect (Cohen’s (d))

Using a two-sided (\alpha=0.05) and 80% power, the usual approximation is:
[
d_{\min} \approx (z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_{0.80})\sqrt{\frac{2}{n_{\text{eff}}}}
]
[
= (1.96 + 0.842)\sqrt{\frac{2}{135.54}}
\approx 2.802 \times 0.1215
\approx 0.34
]

Because cluster trials have **only 30 total schools**, a small-sample (t)-based correction (df (\approx 2J-2 = 28)) is often used:
[
d_{\min} \approx (t_{0.975,28}+t_{0.80,28})\sqrt{\frac{2}{n_{\text{eff}}}}
\approx (2.048+0.855)\times 0.1215
\approx 0.35
]

## Answer

**Minimum detectable effect size:** **(d \approx 0.35)** (roughly **0.34–0.35**, depending on whether you use (z) vs small-sample (t) critical values).

If you tell me whether you planned a **one-sided** test or want to account for **unequal cluster sizes** / **attrition**, I can adjust the MDE.
