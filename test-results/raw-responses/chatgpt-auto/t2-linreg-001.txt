To power the **overall multiple regression** (the omnibus F-test that the **5 predictors jointly** explain variance), you test:

* **H₀:** (R^2 = 0) (predictors explain nothing beyond the intercept)
* **H₁:** (R^2 = 0.10)

### 1) Convert (R^2) to Cohen’s (f^2)

For multiple regression power calculations, we typically use:

[
f^2=\frac{R^2}{1-R^2}
]

With (R^2=0.10):

[
f^2=\frac{0.10}{0.90}=0.1111
]

### 2) Test statistic and degrees of freedom

For (u=5) predictors and total sample size (N):

* Numerator df: (\text{df}_1=u=5)
* Denominator df: (\text{df}_2 = N-u-1 = N-6)

Power is computed for the omnibus F test at (\alpha=0.05), with noncentrality:

[
\lambda = f^2 \cdot (N-u-1)= f^2\cdot (N-6)
]

### 3) Solve for (N) giving 80% power

Using the standard noncentral F framework for the overall regression test, the **smallest** (N) that achieves **80% power** at (\alpha=0.05) is:

* **(N = 127) total subjects**

(At (N=126), power is just under 0.80; at (N=127), it just clears 0.80.)

### Practical note

This is the required **analysis sample size** (complete data). If you expect missing outcomes/covariates or exclusions, inflate accordingly (e.g., 10% missing → target enrollment (\approx 127/0.90 \approx 142)).

If instead you mean “the 5 predictors explain 10% **incremental** variance beyond some baseline covariates,” the calculation changes (it becomes a **partial (R^2)** / (\Delta R^2) test).
