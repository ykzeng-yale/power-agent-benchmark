Assume events follow a **Poisson** process and each subject contributes **1 person-year** of follow-up (no censoring), with equal allocation.

* Control rate: (\lambda_0 = 2) events/person-year
* Treatment rate: (\lambda_1 = 1.5 \times 2 = 3) events/person-year
* Rate ratio: (RR = 1.5), so (\log(RR)=\log(1.5)=0.4055)

### Test approximation (Wald test on (\log(RR)))

For two independent Poisson counts, the variance of the log rate ratio is approximately:
[
\mathrm{Var}(\log \widehat{RR}) \approx \frac{1}{D_1}+\frac{1}{D_0}
]
where (D_0, D_1) are the **expected total events** in control and treatment.

With (n) subjects per group and 1 year each:
[
D_0 = n\lambda_0(1)=2n,\quad D_1 = n\lambda_1(1)=3n
]
So:
[
\frac{1}{D_1}+\frac{1}{D_0}=\frac{1}{3n}+\frac{1}{2n}=\frac{5}{6n}
]

For 80% power at two-sided (\alpha=0.05):
[
z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96,\quad z_{1-\beta}=0.84,\quad z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}=2.80
]

Power condition:
[
\frac{\log(RR)}{\sqrt{5/(6n)}} \ge 2.80
]
Solve for (n):
[
n \ge \frac{5}{6}\left(\frac{2.80}{\log(1.5)}\right)^2
\approx 39.8
]

### Result

✅ **About 40 subjects per group** (so **80 total**) for 80% power at (\alpha=0.05), given 1 year follow-up each.

### Practical note

If you expect **overdispersion** (variance > mean) or **dropout/censoring** that reduces person-time below 1 year, inflate (n) accordingly (often by dividing effective person-time, or multiplying by an overdispersion factor).
