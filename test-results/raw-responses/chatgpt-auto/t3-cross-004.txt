For a **4-period replicate crossover (ABAB / BABA)**, each subject contributes **two A** and **two B** measurements. If we assume:

* residual (within-subject) errors are independent with variance ( \sigma_w^2 )
* you analyze the **within-subject treatment contrast** as
  [
  d_i=\bar Y_{iB}-\bar Y_{iA}
  ]
  where each bar is an average of the two periods on that treatment,

then
[
\mathrm{Var}(d_i)=\mathrm{Var}(\bar Y_{iB})+\mathrm{Var}(\bar Y_{iA})
= \frac{\sigma_w^2}{2}+\frac{\sigma_w^2}{2}=\sigma_w^2.
]

So the **SE of the mean contrast** across (n) subjects is
[
\mathrm{SE}(\bar d)=\frac{\sigma_w}{\sqrt{n}}.
]

You defined the standardized effect as
[
d=\frac{\Delta}{\sigma_w}=0.35,
]
so the z-statistic under the alternative is ( d\sqrt{n} ). For a **two-sided** (\alpha=0.05) test and **power = 0.85**:

* (z_{1-\alpha/2}=z_{0.975}=1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.85}=1.036)

Sample size (normal approximation):
[
n \approx \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{d^2}
= \frac{(1.96+1.036)^2}{0.35^2}
= \frac{(2.996)^2}{0.1225}
\approx \frac{8.98}{0.1225}
\approx 73.3.
]

### Result

* **Total subjects needed: (\boxed{74})** (round up)
* With two sequences, that’s **~37 per sequence** (ABAB and BABA).

**Important caveat (bioequivalence):** true BE studies usually power a **TOST equivalence** test against margins (e.g., 80–125% on log scale) using **within-subject CV** (and sometimes separate CVs for test/reference). If you tell me the BE margin and within-subject CV (or (\sigma_w) on log scale), I can compute the BE-appropriate (N) for the replicate design.
