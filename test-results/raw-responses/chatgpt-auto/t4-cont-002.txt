Using the **Riley et al. “pmsampsize / Riley criteria”** framework for **continuous outcomes (linear regression)**, you take the **largest** sample size required across four checks: (C1) intercept precision, (C2) residual variance precision, (C3) shrinkage ≥ 0.9 (≤10% overfitting), and (C4) small optimism in (R^2) (≈0.05). ([CRAN][1])

## Your inputs

* Outcome: systolic BP (continuous)
* Candidate predictor parameters: (p = 5)
* Anticipated model fit: (R^2 \approx 0.30)
* Outcome mean (\mu \approx 120) mmHg, SD (\sigma \approx 15) mmHg

## The binding (“largest”) criterion here is usually residual SD precision

Riley’s guidance (as implemented in **pmsampsize**) includes a simple closed-form requirement to estimate the **residual standard deviation** precisely: to target a **<10% multiplicative error** in the residual SD, the required sample size is

[
n ;=; 234 + p
]



Plug in (p=5):

[
n = 234 + 5 = 239
]

### Recommended minimum sample size

**(n \approx 239) patients (round to 240).**

## Why your other criteria usually won’t exceed 239 here

* With only **5 predictors** and a moderate anticipated (R^2=0.30), the **shrinkage ≥ 0.9** requirement and the **optimism-in-(R^2)** requirement typically produce smaller (n) than the residual-SD precision rule (this is exactly what Riley’s worked examples often show when (p) is modest). 
* The mean (120) and SD (15) are mainly used for the **intercept precision** criterion; that criterion is rarely the largest unless you demand extremely tight precision. ([CRAN][1])

## Practical add-on (missing data)

If you expect, say, **10% unusable data**, inflate:

[
239 / 0.90 \approx 266
]

So a practical target would be **~265–270**.

If you tell me your expected missingness and whether any predictors are categorical with many levels (which increases “parameters”), I can adjust (p) and the inflation accordingly.
