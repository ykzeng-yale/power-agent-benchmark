Using the standard **log-rank / Schoenfeld** approach (equal randomization, proportional hazards), you do this in two steps:

## 1) Required number of events

For a two-sided test at (\alpha=0.05) and 80% power:

[
D ;=;\frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{\left[\log(HR)\right]^2 , p(1-p)}
\quad\text{with }p=0.5
]

* (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96), (z_{1-\beta}=0.842)
* (HR=0.65\Rightarrow \log(HR)=\log(0.65)=-0.4308)
* (p(1-p)=0.25)

[
D \approx \frac{(1.96+0.842)^2}{(0.4308)^2 \cdot 0.25} \approx 169.2
]

So you need about **170 total events**.

## 2) Convert events to total sample size under your accrual/follow-up

You gave: **2-year accrual + 1-year additional follow-up**, so administrative study end is at **3 years** from start, and each subject is followed between **1 and 3 years** depending on entry time.

Assume **exponential survival** in control:

Control has 50% survival at 2 years:
[
S_c(2)=0.5=\exp(-\lambda_c\cdot 2);\Rightarrow;\lambda_c=\frac{-\ln(0.5)}{2}=0.3466
]
Treatment hazard:
[
\lambda_t = HR\cdot \lambda_c = 0.65\cdot 0.3466 = 0.2253
]

With uniform accrual over 2 years, the **average probability of observing an event** by study end is:
[
\Pr(\text{event}) = 1 - \frac{e^{-\lambda \cdot 3}}{2\lambda}\left(e^{2\lambda}-1\right)
]

Plugging in:

* Control: (\Pr(\text{event}|c)\approx 0.490)
* Treatment: (\Pr(\text{event}|t)\approx 0.357)

Average event fraction (1:1 randomization):
[
\bar{P}=\frac{0.490+0.357}{2}\approx 0.424
]

Total (N) to get (D\approx 169.2) events:
[
N_{\text{total}}=\frac{D}{\bar{P}} \approx \frac{169.2}{0.424}\approx 399.4
]

## Answer

You need about **400 total patients**, i.e. **~200 per arm**.

**Notes (practical):** this assumes no loss to follow-up and exponential survival. If you expect dropout/noncompliance, inflate (N) (e.g., divide by expected retention).
