Treat infections as a **Poisson rate** with equal follow-up time in each arm.

* Control rate: (\lambda_0 = 0.5) infections/month
* Treatment rate: (\lambda_1 = 0.3) infections/month
* Follow-up per subject: (t = 6) months
* Two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* Power (=80% \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=0.84)

### Use a two-sample test for incidence rates (difference in rates)

A common approximation for equal follow-up is:
[
n ;=; \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2(\lambda_0+\lambda_1)}{t(\lambda_0-\lambda_1)^2}
]

Plug in:

* (z)-sum: (1.96+0.84=2.80), square: ((2.80)^2 = 7.84)
* (\lambda_0+\lambda_1 = 0.5+0.3=0.8)
* (\lambda_0-\lambda_1 = 0.2), square: (0.04)
* (t(\lambda_0-\lambda_1)^2 = 6 \times 0.04 = 0.24)

So:
[
n = \frac{7.84 \times 0.8}{0.24} = \frac{6.272}{0.24}=26.13
]

### Result

You need **about 27 participants per group** (rounding up) for **80% power** at **two-sided (\alpha=0.05)**.

**Practical note:** if you expect **dropout** or **overdispersion** (infection counts often are), inflate this (e.g., +10–20% or by an overdispersion factor).
