We can approximate this as a **two‐arm comparison of group means** using the **within-subject average across repeated visits** (which is what you effectively gain power from under compound symmetry / ICC).

### 1) Setup

* Standardized treatment effect for a *single* monthly measurement: **(d = 0.35)**
  (i.e., mean difference (=; d \cdot \sigma), where (\sigma) is the SD of an individual visit outcome)
* Repeated measures per subject: **(m = 6)** monthly visits (over 6 months)
* Compound symmetry correlation (ICC): **(\rho = 0.4)**
* Two-sided **(\alpha = 0.05)**, power **(1-\beta = 0.90)**

### 2) Variance reduction from averaging repeated measures (CS / ICC)

For (m) measurements with equal variance (\sigma^2) and pairwise correlation (\rho),
the variance of the **subject-level mean** (\bar{Y}) is:

[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar{Y}) = \sigma^2 \cdot \frac{1 + (m-1)\rho}{m}.
]

So the SD of the subject mean is:

[
\sigma_{\bar{Y}} = \sigma \sqrt{\frac{1 + (m-1)\rho}{m}}.
]

That means the **effective standardized effect size** when using all repeated measures is inflated to:

[
d_{\text{eff}} ;=; \frac{d \cdot \sigma}{\sigma_{\bar{Y}}}
= d \sqrt{\frac{m}{1+(m-1)\rho}}.
]

Plug in (m=6), (\rho=0.4):

[
1+(m-1)\rho = 1 + 5(0.4)=1+2=3,
]
[
d_{\text{eff}} = 0.35 \sqrt{\frac{6}{3}} = 0.35 \sqrt{2} \approx 0.35(1.414)=0.495.
]

### 3) Two-sample size formula

For equal allocation, the usual normal-approximation sample size per arm is:

[
n ;=; \frac{2\left(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}\right)^2}{d_{\text{eff}}^2}.
]

Critical values:

* (z_{1-\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \approx 1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.90} \approx 1.2816)

Compute:

[
z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta} \approx 1.96 + 1.2816 = 3.2416,
]
[
(3.2416)^2 \approx 10.512,
]
[
n = \frac{2(10.512)}{(0.495)^2}.
]

[
(0.495)^2 \approx 0.245,
\quad
n \approx \frac{21.024}{0.245} \approx 85.8.
]

### Result

**(\boxed{n \approx 86 \text{ subjects per arm}})** (so **172 total**), assuming complete data and CS(ICC=0.4).

### Quick practical note (attrition)

If you expect dropout/missed visits, inflate roughly by (1/(1-\text{dropout})).
Example: 15% dropout ⇒ (86/0.85 \approx 102) per arm.

If you tell me whether you have a **baseline measurement** (and whether the estimand is **difference at month 6** vs **overall mean difference across follow-ups** vs **treatment×time slope**), I can tailor the formula more tightly—but **86/arm** is a solid CS-based planning number for a constant treatment effect over 6 monthly visits.
