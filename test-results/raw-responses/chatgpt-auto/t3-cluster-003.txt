Using the usual **design-effect (DE)** approach for a 2-arm cluster RCT with a continuous outcome:

### 1) Inflation from clustering + unequal cluster sizes

A common approximation with variable cluster sizes (coefficient of variation **CV**) is

[
DE ;=; 1+\rho\Big(\bar m(1+CV^2)-1\Big),
]

where (\rho=) ICC and (\bar m=) mean cluster size.

Plug in (\rho=0.03,; \bar m=20,; CV=0.4 \Rightarrow CV^2=0.16):

[
DE = 1+0.03\big(20(1.16)-1\big)
= 1+0.03(23.2-1)
= 1+0.666
= 1.666.
]

### 2) Effective sample size

You have (25) clusters/arm × (20) subjects/cluster = **500 subjects per arm** (nominal).

[
n_{\text{eff, per arm}} = \frac{500}{1.666} \approx 300.1.
]

### 3) Power for standardized effect (d=0.3), two-sided (\alpha=0.05)

For equal groups, the large-sample z/t approximation uses the noncentrality

[
\lambda = d\sqrt{\frac{n_{\text{eff}}}{2}}
= 0.3\sqrt{\frac{300.1}{2}}
\approx 3.675.
]

If we use a **t critical value based on clusters** (df (\approx 2k-2 = 48), where (k=25) clusters/arm), the two-sided cutoff is (t_{0.975,48}\approx 2.011).

That gives power approximately:

[
\text{Power} \approx P(|T_{48,\lambda}|>2.011) \approx 0.95.
]

✅ **Estimated power ≈ 95%** (about **0.95**, i.e., **95.0%**).

**Notes (what this assumes):**

* Outcome is approximately continuous/normal with a common SD (since you’re using Cohen’s (d)).
* Primary analysis behaves like an individual-level model with appropriate clustering adjustment; the DE approach is an approximation (good for planning).
* Using df based on **clusters** (48) is slightly more conservative than pure z; that’s why it’s ~95% rather than ~96%.
