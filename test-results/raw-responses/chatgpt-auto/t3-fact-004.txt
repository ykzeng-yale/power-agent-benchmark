Treat each main effect as a **difference in means** between the “+” and “−” settings of that factor.

### 1) How many observations contribute to a main effect?

* 8 runs, **3 replicates/run** → total (N = 8\times 3 = 24).
* For any factor in a balanced 2-level design, half the runs are at “+” and half at “−”.

  * “+” side: (4) runs × (3) reps = (12) observations
  * “−” side: (12) observations

So the main-effect estimator is
[
\hat{\beta} = \bar{Y}*{+} - \bar{Y}*{-}.
]

### 2) Standard error of a main effect (in (\sigma) units)

Assuming independent errors with common SD (\sigma),
[
\mathrm{SE}(\hat{\beta})=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{12}+\frac{\sigma^2}{12}}
=\sigma\sqrt{\frac{2}{12}}
=\sigma\sqrt{\frac{1}{6}}
\approx 0.408,\sigma.
]

You gave a standardized true main effect
[
\delta = \frac{\beta}{\sigma}=1.5 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \beta = 1.5\sigma.
]

So the noncentrality parameter for the t-test is
[
\lambda=\frac{\beta}{\mathrm{SE}(\hat{\beta})}
=\frac{1.5\sigma}{0.408\sigma}
=1.5\sqrt{6}
\approx 3.674.
]

### 3) Degrees of freedom and critical value

With replication, the **pure error df** is
[
df = 8,(3-1)=16.
]
Two-sided (\alpha=0.05) gives
[
t_{0.975,16}\approx 2.120.
]

### 4) Power

Power is
[
\Pr\left(|T|>t_{0.975,16}\ \middle|\ T\sim t_{16}(\text{noncentral } \lambda=3.674)\right)
\approx 0.931.
]

**Answer:** you have about **93% power** (≈ **0.931**) to detect a main effect of (\delta=1.5) at **two-sided (\alpha=0.05)** (per main-effect test).

*Note:* Resolution IV affects aliasing (e.g., main effects vs 3-factor interactions), but **doesn’t change the standard error/power calculation** for a balanced main-effect contrast under the usual iid-error model. If you plan to adjust for testing multiple main effects (e.g., Bonferroni over 4 tests), power per effect would drop.
