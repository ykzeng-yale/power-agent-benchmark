Assuming you’re powering a one-way fixed-effects ANOVA across 6 centers (equal n per center) with Cohen’s f = 0.40, α = 0.01, and power = 0.95:

Required total sample size N≈168.67N \approx 168.67

With 6 centers, that’s 168.67/6≈28.11168.67 / 6 \approx 28.11 per center → round up to 29 subjects per center.

Answer: 29 subjects per center (total N=174N = 174).
(For reference: 28 per center gives power ≈ 0.949, just under 0.95; 29 per center gives power ≈ 0.958.)
