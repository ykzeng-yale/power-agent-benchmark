Because each subject in a 3-treatment Latin square crossover receives **both treatment A and control**, your primary analysis for **A vs control** is essentially a **within-subject (paired) comparison**.

### 1) Convert the “between-person” effect size to a paired effect size

Let:

* (d = \Delta/\sigma = 0.4) (standardized by the **single-period** SD (\sigma))
* Period-to-period correlation ( \rho = 0.6 ) (compound symmetry)

For a paired difference (D = Y_A - Y_C),

[
\mathrm{SD}(D) = \sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(Y_A)+\mathrm{Var}(Y_C)-2\mathrm{Cov}(Y_A,Y_C)}
= \sigma\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}.
]

So the paired standardized effect (Cohen’s (d_z)) is

[
d_z = \frac{\Delta}{\sigma\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}} = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}}.
]

Plug in:

[
d_z = \frac{0.4}{\sqrt{2(1-0.6)}}=\frac{0.4}{\sqrt{0.8}}
= \frac{0.4}{0.8944} \approx 0.447.
]

### 2) Paired-sample size formula (normal approximation)

Two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
Power (=0.80 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=0.84)

[
n \approx \left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{d_z}\right)^2
= \left(\frac{1.96+0.84}{0.447}\right)^2
= \left(\frac{2.80}{0.447}\right)^2
\approx (6.26)^2 \approx 39.2.
]

### Answer

**You need about 40 subjects total** (since it’s crossover, that’s **40 subjects overall**, not per arm).

Practical note: if you want a tiny cushion for the t-distribution / occasional missing period, you might plan **42–45**.
