You’ve got **2 groups** (treatment vs control) and **2 measurements per person** (baseline and 8 weeks), with within-person correlation (\rho = \text{ICC}=0.6). A clean way to power this is to think in terms of the **difference in change**:

[
(Y_{\text{8wk}}-Y_{\text{base}})*{\text{Tx}} ;-; (Y*{\text{8wk}}-Y_{\text{base}})_{\text{Ctrl}}
]

I’ll show the math and give you the per-group (n).

## Step 1: Translate the repeated-measures correlation into the SD of a change score

Assume the outcome SD at baseline and 8 weeks is the same: (\sigma), and the within-person correlation is (\rho).

For one subject,
[
\mathrm{Var}(Y_{\text{8wk}}-Y_{\text{base}})=\mathrm{Var}(Y_{\text{8wk}})+\mathrm{Var}(Y_{\text{base}})-2\mathrm{Cov}(Y_{\text{8wk}},Y_{\text{base}})
]
[
= \sigma^2+\sigma^2-2(\rho\sigma^2)=2\sigma^2(1-\rho)
]

So the **SD of a change score** is:
[
\sigma_{\Delta}=\sigma\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}
]

With (\rho=0.6):
[
\sigma_{\Delta}=\sigma\sqrt{2(1-0.6)}=\sigma\sqrt{0.8}=0.8944,\sigma
]

---

## Step 2: Convert your effect size (d=0.4) into an effect size for change scores

You said “treatment effect (d=0.4)”. Commonly, that means the true mean difference in change is
[
\Delta = 0.4,\sigma
]

Then the standardized effect on the change score scale is
[
d_{\text{change}}=\frac{\Delta}{\sigma_{\Delta}}=\frac{0.4\sigma}{0.8944\sigma}=0.4472
]

---

## Step 3: Use the two-sample (t)-test sample size formula (two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (=0.80))

Normal-approximation critical values:

* (\alpha=0.05) two-sided (\Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=z_{0.975}=1.96)
* power (0.80) (\Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.80}=0.84)

For equal group sizes, the per-group sample size is
[
n ;=; \frac{2,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{d_{\text{change}}^2}
]

Plug in:
[
n=\frac{2,(1.96+0.84)^2}{(0.4472)^2}
=\frac{2,(2.80)^2}{0.20}
=\frac{2\cdot 7.84}{0.20}
=\frac{15.68}{0.20}
=78.4
]

So you round up to:

### **(\boxed{n \approx 79 \text{ subjects per group}})**

---

## Practical note (often important): ANCOVA usually needs fewer than change-score analysis

If you plan to analyze **8-week outcome adjusted for baseline (ANCOVA)**, the residual variance factor is ((1-\rho^2)) rather than (2(1-\rho)). That typically improves power when (\rho) is moderate/high.

ANCOVA per-group (n) (same (d=0.4) defined vs (\sigma)):

[
n = \frac{2,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2(1-\rho^2)}{d^2}
]

With (\rho=0.6): (1-\rho^2=1-0.36=0.64)

[
n=\frac{2\cdot 7.84\cdot 0.64}{0.16}
=\frac{10.0352}{0.16}
=62.72 \Rightarrow 63
]

### **ANCOVA estimate: (\boxed{n \approx 63 \text{ per group}})**

---

## Bottom line

* If you power for a **change-score comparison**: **~79 per group**
* If you power for **ANCOVA (8-week adjusted for baseline)**: **~63 per group** (often the recommended primary analysis)

If you tell me which analysis you’ll declare as primary (change-score vs ANCOVA / mixed model), I’ll anchor the final recommendation to that and also add a quick inflation for dropout (e.g., 10–20%).
