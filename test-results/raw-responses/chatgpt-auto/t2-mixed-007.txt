For a standard **2×2 AB/BA crossover** analyzed as a **within-subject (paired) treatment contrast** (and assuming no important carryover and complete data), the treatment effect is tested using each subject as their own control.

### 1) Variance of the within-subject treatment difference

Let total SD of a single measurement be ( \sigma), and within-subject correlation be ( \rho = 0.7).

If (Y_A) and (Y_B) are the two period outcomes for the same subject (under treatments A and B), then the within-subject difference has variance

[
\mathrm{Var}(Y_A - Y_B)= \sigma^2 + \sigma^2 - 2\rho\sigma^2
= 2\sigma^2(1-\rho).
]

So the SD of the difference is
[
\sigma_D = \sigma\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}.
]

### 2) Convert your effect size (d) to the paired-scale effect

You gave (d = 0.6) **standardized by the total SD** (\sigma), i.e. the mean treatment difference is
[
\delta = d,\sigma = 0.6\sigma.
]

On the paired-difference scale, the standardized effect is
[
d_{\text{paired}} = \frac{\delta}{\sigma_D}
= \frac{d\sigma}{\sigma\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}}
= \frac{d}{\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}}.
]

Plugging in (d=0.6), (\rho=0.7):
[
d_{\text{paired}} = \frac{0.6}{\sqrt{2(1-0.7)}} = \frac{0.6}{\sqrt{0.6}} \approx 0.7746.
]

### 3) Sample size for two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (=0.85)

Using the usual normal approximation for a paired (t)-test:

[
n \approx \left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{d_{\text{paired}}}\right)^2
]

with (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96) and (z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.85}\approx 1.036):

[
n \approx \left(\frac{1.96+1.036}{0.7746}\right)^2
\approx 14.96.
]

### Answer

* **Minimum:** **15 subjects total** (which yields ~85% power under the normal approximation).
* **Conservative (recommended):** **16 subjects total** to buffer the small-sample (t)-critical value and any minor deviations.

If you randomize equally:

* **15 total** → typically **8 in one sequence and 7 in the other**
* **16 total** → **8 AB and 8 BA**

If you expect dropouts/missing period-2 data, inflate accordingly (since losing period 2 breaks the within-subject comparison for that person).
