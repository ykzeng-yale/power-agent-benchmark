For a **two-sample comparison of means** (treatment vs control), equal allocation, using **Cohen’s d**:

* (d = \dfrac{\mu_T - \mu_C}{\sigma})
* Two-sided (\alpha = 0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \approx 1.96)
* Power (= 0.80 \Rightarrow \beta = 0.20 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.80} \approx 0.84)

A common planning formula (normal approximation) for **per-group** sample size is:

[
n ;=; \frac{2,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{d^2}
]

Plug in values:

[
n ;=; \frac{2,(1.96+0.84)^2}{0.5^2}
= \frac{2,(2.80)^2}{0.25}
= \frac{2\cdot 7.84}{0.25}
= \frac{15.68}{0.25}
= 62.72
]

So you round up:

* **(n = 63) participants per group** (total **126**).

Practical note: because the exact t-test uses a t critical value (slightly larger than 1.96 at these df), many people pad to **64 per group**. And if you expect attrition, divide by ((1-\text{dropout rate})) and round up (e.g., 10% dropout → (63/0.9 \approx 70) per group).
