In a 2×2 bioequivalence **crossover** (same subjects receive both formulations), the usual power calculation is the **paired (within-subject) mean difference** test. If you express the target difference as a standardized effect size

[
d=\frac{\Delta}{\sigma_d}
]

(where (\sigma_d) is the **SD of the within-subject differences**), then an approximate sample size is:

[
n ;=;\left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{d}\right)^2
]

### Plug in your values

* Power (=95%\Rightarrow \beta=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.95}=1.645)
* “Stricter (\alpha=0.01)” is typically **two-sided** unless you explicitly say one-sided:

  * Two-sided (\alpha=0.01 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=z_{0.995}=2.576)
* (d = 0.25)

So:

[
n=\left(\frac{2.576+1.645}{0.25}\right)^2
=\left(\frac{4.221}{0.25}\right)^2
=(16.884)^2
\approx 285.1
]

### Result

* **You need about (\mathbf{286}) subjects** (round up) **who complete both periods**.

### If you actually meant one-sided (\alpha=0.01)

Then (z_{1-\alpha}=z_{0.99}=2.326):

[
n=\left(\frac{2.326+1.645}{0.25}\right)^2
=\left(\frac{3.971}{0.25}\right)^2
=(15.884)^2
\approx 252.3
]

* **About (\mathbf{253})** completers.

### Practical note (dropout)

Crossover studies often inflate for dropouts since incomplete subjects may be unusable for the paired analysis. For example, with 10% dropout:

* Two-sided case: (286/0.90 \approx 318) → **~318 subjects to enroll**

If you tell me whether your (\alpha=0.01) is **one- or two-sided** (and your expected dropout), I’ll give the final enrollment target.
