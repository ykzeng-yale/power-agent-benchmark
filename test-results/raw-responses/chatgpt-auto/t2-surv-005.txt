Using the standard **log-rank (Schoenfeld/Freedman) event-based approach**:

### 1) Required number of events

For equal allocation (1:1), two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (=80%):

* (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta}=0.84)
* (\log(HR)=\log(0.70)=-0.3567)
* Allocation factor (p(1-p)=0.5\cdot0.5=0.25)

[
D ;=; \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{(\log HR)^2 , p(1-p)}
;=; \frac{(1.96+0.84)^2}{(0.3567)^2 \cdot 0.25}
\approx 246.5
]

So you need about **247 total events**.

### 2) Convert events to total sample size (given 36-month total duration)

Assume:

* **Exponential survival** (consistent with specifying a median)
* **Uniform accrual over the full 36 months**
* Follow-up until study end at 36 months
* No loss to follow-up

Control hazard from median 18 months:
[
\lambda_c=\frac{\ln 2}{18}=0.0385 \text{ per month}
]
Treatment hazard:
[
\lambda_t=0.70\lambda_c=0.0270
]

With uniform entry over ([0,36]), average event probability by study end is:

* Control: (\approx 0.459)
* Treatment: (\approx 0.360)

Average across arms (1:1):
[
\bar{p}_{event}\approx \frac{0.459+0.360}{2}=0.4095
]

Thus total (N):
[
N=\frac{D}{\bar{p}_{event}} \approx \frac{246.5}{0.4095}=602.0
]

### ✅ Total sample size

**≈ 602 participants total** (about **301 per arm**), under the assumptions above.

### Quick sensitivity note (because “total study duration = 36 months” can mean different accrual/follow-up splits)

If instead you had **shorter accrual** and **more minimum follow-up**, the required **N would drop** (more events observed). For example, if accrual were 24 months with study end still at 36 months, the average event probability is higher and (N) would be roughly **~467 total**.

If you tell me your **accrual period** (e.g., “accrue for 24 months, then follow everyone to 36”), I can lock the exact (N) to your design.
