Assuming a **cross-sectional stepped-wedge** (new participants each period within each cluster) and a continuous outcome with **unit variance** so that **d = 0.5** is a standardized mean difference:

## 1) Translate ICCs into the covariance of cluster-period means

Let (m) = subjects per **cluster-period**.

* Individual variance: (\mathrm{Var}(Y)=1)
* Same cluster, same period corr: (\rho_w = 0.05)
* Same cluster, different periods corr: (\rho_b = 0.025)

For a given cluster and period, the **cluster-period mean** (\bar Y_{ct}) has

[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar Y_{ct})
= \frac{1}{m}\Big[1 + (m-1)\rho_w\Big]
= \rho_w + \frac{1-\rho_w}{m}
= 0.05 + \frac{0.95}{m}.
]

For two different periods (t\neq s) in the same cluster (different people, but correlated at (\rho_b)):

[
\mathrm{Cov}(\bar Y_{ct}, \bar Y_{cs}) = \rho_b = 0.025.
]

So each cluster contributes a (4\times 4) covariance matrix with diagonal (0.05+0.95/m) and off-diagonals (0.025).

Clusters are independent, so the full covariance is block-diagonal over the 6 clusters.

## 2) The stepped-wedge assignment

With 6 clusters over 4 periods, switching **2 clusters per period**, the treatment indicators by period are:

* Period 1: 0 treated
* Period 2: 2 treated / 4 control
* Period 3: 4 treated / 2 control
* Period 4: 6 treated

(Exact which clusters switch when doesn’t change the information here as long as it’s balanced like this.)

## 3) Model and degrees of freedom

Use the standard Hussey–Hughes style analysis on **cluster-period means**:

[
\bar Y_{ct} = \mu + \text{(period fixed effects)} + \beta , \text{Treat}*{ct} + \epsilon*{ct},
]

estimated by GLS using the covariance above.

Number of observations = (6\times 4 = 24) cluster-period means.

Parameters: intercept (1) + period FE (3) + treatment (1) = 5
So df (\approx 24-5 = 19).

## 4) Power condition and solving for (m)

Two-sided (\alpha=0.05), target power (=0.80).

Compute (\mathrm{SE}(\hat\beta)) from
[
\mathrm{Var}(\hat\beta)=\Big(X^\top \Sigma^{-1}X\Big)^{-1}_{\beta\beta}.
]

Then power is approximated with a noncentral (t) using df (=19) and noncentrality
[
\lambda = \frac{d}{\mathrm{SE}(\hat\beta)}.
]

Carrying this through numerically, the **smallest** (m) giving at least 80% power is:

[
\boxed{m = 29 \text{ subjects per cluster-period}.}
]

### What that implies in totals

* Per cluster across 4 periods: (4\times 29 = 116)
* Total participants: (6\times 4 \times 29 = 696)

---

### Notes (so you don’t get surprised later)

* This answer is for a **cross-sectional** stepped-wedge (different people each period). If it’s a **closed cohort** (same individuals followed over periods), the required (m) can change a lot (often smaller), because within-person correlation adds information differently.
* Also assumes **no attrition/missingness** and correct specification of the period effects.

If you tell me whether it’s cross-sectional vs cohort (and any expected dropout), I can adjust the number.
