In a 2×2 crossover, the treatment comparison is typically analyzed as a **within-subject (paired) mean difference**, so the sample size is the same as for a **one-sample/paired t-test** on the within-subject differences.

### Given

* Expected mean difference in AUC: (\Delta = 50)
* Within-subject SD (SD of paired differences): (\sigma_w = 100)
* Power: (1-\beta = 0.85 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.85} \approx 1.036)
* Two-sided (\alpha = 0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \approx 1.96)

### Sample size formula (paired / crossover comparison)

[
n ;=;\left(\frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}),\sigma_w}{\Delta}\right)^2
]

Plug in:
[
n = \left(\frac{(1.96 + 1.036)\cdot 100}{50}\right)^2
= \left((2.996)\cdot 2\right)^2
= (5.992)^2
\approx 35.9
]

### Result

[
\boxed{n \approx 36 \text{ subjects (total)}}
]

That’s **36 participants completing both periods** (since each subject receives both formulations).

*Practical note:* if you expect dropouts, inflate: e.g., 10% dropout (\Rightarrow 36/0.90 = 40) subjects.
