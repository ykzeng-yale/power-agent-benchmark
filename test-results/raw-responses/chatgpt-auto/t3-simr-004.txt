Assuming **randomization is at the school level** (because you specify “per arm: 10 schools”), the test is effectively a **two-sample comparison of school-level mean outcomes**, where each school mean is estimated from 4 classrooms × 25 students.

### 1) Given variance components (they sum to 1)

* Between-school variance: (\sigma^2_S = 0.05)
* Between-classroom-within-school variance: (\sigma^2_C = 0.10)
* Student-level residual variance: (\sigma^2_E = 0.85)
  Total variance (= 1.00), so an effect size (d=0.3) corresponds to an absolute mean difference (\Delta = 0.3).

### 2) Variance of one arm’s mean (with 10 schools/arm)

Let:

* (J=10) schools per arm
* (K=4) classrooms per school
* (m=25) students per classroom

The variance of the arm mean is:
[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar{Y}_{\text{arm}})=
\frac{\sigma^2_S}{J}
+\frac{\sigma^2_C}{JK}
+\frac{\sigma^2_E}{JKm}
]

Plug in:
[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar{Y}_{\text{arm}})=
\frac{0.05}{10}+\frac{0.10}{10\cdot 4}+\frac{0.85}{10\cdot 4\cdot 25}
=0.005+0.0025+0.00085
=0.00835
]

For a balanced two-arm difference in means:
[
\mathrm{Var}(\hat\Delta)=2\times 0.00835=0.0167
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
SE(\hat\Delta)=\sqrt{0.0167}=0.129
]

### 3) Noncentrality and power at (\alpha=0.05) (two-sided)

[
\text{NCP}=\frac{\Delta}{SE}=\frac{0.3}{0.129}\approx 2.32
]

Because the **school is the randomization unit**, a common approximation uses a **t-test with df (\approx 2J-2 = 18)**. The critical value is:
[
t_{0.975,18}\approx 2.101
]

Using a noncentral t with df = 18 and NCP ≈ 2.32 gives:

**Power (\approx 0.59) (about 59%)**.

### Quick interpretation

Even though you have (10\times 4\times 25 = 1000) students per arm, the **effective information is capped by the 10 schools/arm**, because the school component ((0.05)) and classroom component ((0.10)) induce correlation that doesn’t vanish with more students.

If you tell me whether randomization is instead at the **classroom level** (within schools), power would be higher and the df structure changes—but under **school-level randomization**, **~59%** is the right ballpark.
