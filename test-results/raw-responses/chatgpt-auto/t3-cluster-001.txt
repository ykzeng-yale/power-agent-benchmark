To map your **cluster randomized** design onto the usual two-sample effect size (d), a handy planning approach is:

1. **Start with the individual-randomized requirement** for a continuous outcome (two-sided (\alpha=0.05), 80% power):

[
n_{\text{indiv, per arm}}
;=;
\frac{2,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{d^2}
]

With (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96), (z_{1-\beta}=0.84), (d=0.4):

[
n_{\text{indiv, per arm}}
=========================

# \frac{2(1.96+0.84)^2}{0.4^2}

# \frac{2(2.8)^2}{0.16}

\frac{15.68}{0.16}
\approx 98
]

So, **about 98 effective individuals per arm** if there were no clustering.

2. **Account for clustering** with ICC (\rho=0.05) and (m) patients/clinic. The usual “design effect” is:

[
DE = 1 + (m-1)\rho
]

Your design has **(k=20) clinics per arm**, so the *effective* sample size per arm is roughly:

[
n_{\text{eff, per arm}}
=======================

# \frac{k,m}{DE}

\frac{20m}{1+(m-1)0.05}
]

We want (n_{\text{eff, per arm}} \gtrsim 98).

Solving this gives (m \gtrsim 6.2), so you’d round up to 7.

3. **Small-sample (cluster) degrees-of-freedom check**

In cluster trials, inference is often driven by the number of clusters (df (\approx 2k-2 = 38)). Using that standard df adjustment still gives:

* (m=6) → power (\approx 0.77)
* **(m=7) → power (\approx 0.82)** ✅
* (m=8) → power (\approx 0.85)

## Answer

**You need about *7 patients per clinic*** (with **20 clinics per arm**) to achieve **80% power** at **(\alpha=0.05)** for detecting **(d=0.4)** with **ICC = 0.05**.

That corresponds to totals of:

* **Per arm:** (20 \times 7 = 140) patients
* **Overall:** (280) patients

If you expect **attrition**, **unequal clinic sizes**, or want a bit of cushion, planning **8–10 per clinic** is a common practical move.
