To power a **test of correlation** (usually (H_0:\rho=0) vs (H_1:\rho\neq 0)) we typically use the **Fisher (z) transform**:

[
z(,r,)=\operatorname{atanh}(r)=\frac12\ln!\left(\frac{1+r}{1-r}\right)
]

Under (H_0:\rho=\rho_0), the transformed sample correlation is approximately Normal with

[
z(\hat r)\sim N!\left(z(\rho_0),\ \frac{1}{n-3}\right)
]

So the “signal” you’re trying to detect is

[
\Delta = z(\rho_1)-z(\rho_0)
]

and the required sample size for a **two-sided** test is

[
n \approx 3+\left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{\Delta}\right)^2
]

### Plug in your values

* Expected correlation: (\rho_1 = 0.5)
* Null correlation (typical): (\rho_0 = 0)
* Power (=95%\Rightarrow \beta=0.05)
* (\alpha=0.01) (two-sided unless you explicitly mean one-sided)

1. Fisher transform difference
   [
   z(0.5)=\operatorname{atanh}(0.5)=0.5493,\quad z(0)=0
   ]
   [
   \Delta=0.5493
   ]

2. Critical values
   [
   z_{1-\alpha/2}=z_{0.995}=2.5758,\quad z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.95}=1.6449
   ]

3. Sample size
   [
   n \approx 3+\left(\frac{2.5758+1.6449}{0.5493}\right)^2
   = 3 + (7.684)^2
   = 3 + 59.04
   = 62.04
   ]

### Result

* You need **(n = 63)** participants (round up) for **95% power at (\alpha=0.01)** to detect a true correlation of **0.5** vs **0** (two-sided).

### If you meant a one-sided test

If you truly only care about correlation in one direction, use (z_{1-\alpha}=z_{0.99}=2.3263):

[
n \approx 3+\left(\frac{2.3263+1.6449}{0.5493}\right)^2 \approx 55.27 \Rightarrow \boxed{56}
]

If your null is **not** (\rho_0=0) (e.g., you want to distinguish 0.3 vs 0.5), tell me (\rho_0) and I’ll recompute using (\Delta = \operatorname{atanh}(\rho_1)-\operatorname{atanh}(\rho_0)).
