Assuming you mean **testing the overall multiple regression** (i.e., *H₀: all 15 regression coefficients = 0*, equivalently **R² = 0**), the standard approach is the **F-test for multiple R²**.

### 1) Convert expected R² to Cohen’s (f^2)

For multiple regression,
[
f^2=\frac{R^2}{1-R^2}
]
With (R^2=0.05):
[
f^2=\frac{0.05}{0.95}=0.0526316
]

### 2) Set up the F-test degrees of freedom

* Number of predictors tested: (u = 15)
* Total sample size: (N)
* Denominator df:
  [
  v = N-u-1 = N-16
  ]

### 3) Power calculation (noncentral F)

For the overall regression F-test, power is computed using a **noncentral F** distribution with:

* df1 (= u = 15)
* df2 (= v = N-16)
* noncentrality parameter:
  [
  \lambda = f^2 \cdot v = 0.0526316 \cdot (N-16)
  ]
  Critical value:
  [
  F_{\text{crit}} = F^{-1}(1-\alpha;; u,; v),\quad \alpha=0.01
  ]
  Power:
  [
  \text{Power} = P\left(F > F_{\text{crit}} \mid \text{noncentral }F(u,v,\lambda)\right)
  ]

### 4) Result

Solving for **95% power** at **α = 0.01** with (u=15) and (R^2=0.05):

* **Minimum total sample size:** **(N = 704)**
* This corresponds to (v = 704-16 = 688) and yields power ≈ **0.950**.

### Practical note

In observational epi studies you often lose effective N due to missingness/exclusions. A common quick adjustment is:

* If you expect ~10% unusable data: (704 / 0.90 \approx 783)
* If ~20% unusable data: (704 / 0.80 = 880)

### If your real goal is different

This (N=704) is for the **global test of R² > 0**. If instead you care about:

* **detecting a specific predictor** (partial (R^2) / t-test),
* **multiple-testing control across 15 predictors**, or
* **prediction accuracy / shrinkage / calibration**,

…the required N can change a lot.

But for the question as stated (15 predictors, overall (R^2\approx 5%), α=0.01, 95% power): **plan for about 704 participants total**.
