For a standard **2×2 crossover (AB/BA)** with a continuous outcome, the treatment effect is typically tested using the **within-subject treatment difference** (equivalent to a paired (t)-test / linear mixed model treatment contrast). With your definition

[
d ;=; \frac{\mu_A-\mu_B}{\sigma_w}
]

where (\sigma_w) is the **SD of the within-subject treatment difference** (i.e., the SD of (A-B) across subjects), the required **number of subjects** is the same as for a paired design:

[
n ;=; \left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta}}{d}\right)^2
]

Plug in:

* two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=z_{0.975}=1.95996)
* power (=90% \Rightarrow \beta=0.10 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.90}=1.28155)
* (d=0.3)

[
n ;=;\left(\frac{1.95996+1.28155}{0.3}\right)^2
=\left(\frac{3.24151}{0.3}\right)^2
=(10.80505)^2
=116.75
]

So you need:

**✅ (n = 117) subjects total** (i.e., 117 randomized to sequences AB vs BA, roughly half in each sequence).

Practical note: if you expect dropouts/missing period-2 data, inflate by (1/(1-\text{dropout rate})) (e.g., 10% dropout → (117/0.9 \approx 130)).
