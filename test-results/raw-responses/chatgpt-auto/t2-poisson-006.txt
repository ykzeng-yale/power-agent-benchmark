Here’s a clean way to size this as a **2-arm Poisson rate ratio** test over **3 years of follow-up per person**, assuming:

* events follow a Poisson process (no overdispersion),
* equal follow-up in both groups (no dropout),
* the treatment multiplies the rate by a constant **rate ratio RR = 0.8** at all times,
* two-sided **α = 0.05**, power **80%**.

## 1) Convert the “+10% per year” into expected events per subject

You said the control rate is **1 event/person-year at time 0** and increases by **10% per year**.

### Option A (smooth growth in continuous time)

Model the instantaneous control rate as
[
\lambda_0(t)=1\cdot(1.1)^t,\quad t\text{ in years.}
]

Expected control events per subject over 3 years:
[
\mu_0=\int_{0}^{3}(1.1)^t,dt=\frac{1.1^3-1}{\ln(1.1)}
\approx \frac{1.331-1}{0.09531}\approx 3.473.
]

Treatment group has RR = 0.8, so
[
\mu_1 = 0.8,\mu_0 \approx 2.778.
]

### Option B (stepwise increase each year)

If instead you mean the rate is constant within each year:

* Year 1: 1.00
* Year 2: 1.10
* Year 3: 1.21

Then
[
\mu_0 = 1+1.1+1.21 = 3.31,\quad \mu_1 = 0.8\cdot 3.31 = 2.648.
]

## 2) Use the standard log rate ratio test approximation

For two independent Poisson totals, an approximate variance is:
[
\mathrm{Var}(\log \widehat{RR}) \approx \frac{1}{E_1}+\frac{1}{E_0},
]
where (E_g) is the expected **total** number of events in group (g).

With (n) per group:
[
E_0=n\mu_0,\quad E_1=n\mu_1=n(0.8\mu_0).
]

So:
[
\frac{1}{E_1}+\frac{1}{E_0}
= \frac{1}{n(0.8\mu_0)}+\frac{1}{n\mu_0}
= \frac{2.25}{n\mu_0}.
]

Power condition (two-sided):
[
\frac{|\log(0.8)|}{\sqrt{2.25/(n\mu_0)}} \ge z_{0.975}+z_{0.80}.
]
With (z_{0.975}=1.96), (z_{0.80}=0.84), (|\log(0.8)|=0.2231):
[
n\mu_0 \ge \left(\frac{(1.96+0.84)\cdot 1.5}{0.2231}\right)^2
\approx 354.6.
]
Thus
[
n \ge \frac{354.6}{\mu_0}.
]

---

## 3) Plug in (\mu_0)

### If you assume smooth (continuous) 10% growth

[
n \ge \frac{354.6}{3.473} \approx 102.1
\Rightarrow \boxed{103\text{ subjects per group}}.
]

### If you assume stepwise yearly increases

[
n \ge \frac{354.6}{3.31} \approx 107.1
\Rightarrow \boxed{108\text{ subjects per group}}.
]

---

## Practical notes (often important)

* **Dropout / incomplete follow-up:** inflate by dividing by expected retention (e.g., 15% loss → divide by 0.85).
* **Overdispersion (extra-Poisson variation):** inflate by the dispersion factor (e.g., (\phi=1.3) → multiply (n) by 1.3).

If you tell me whether the “10% per year” is meant **smoothly** or **year-by-year step**, and your expected **dropout** or **overdispersion**, I’ll give you a single final number with the appropriate inflation.
