Here’s a standard **Hsieh/Lachin-style** power approximation for a **single continuous predictor** in a multivariable logistic regression, with the other covariates accounted for via the **partial (R^2)** (your “confounders explain 10% of variance in the predictor”).

## 1) Translate your inputs

* Main predictor (X): continuous, Normal, scaled **per 1 SD** of the biomarker.
* Target effect: (\text{OR}=1.8) per SD
  [
  \beta=\log(1.8)=0.5878
  ]
* Baseline (overall) event rate: (\pi = 0.15)
* Confounders explain (R^2=0.10) of the variance in (X)
  [
  \mathrm{Var}(X\mid \text{confounders}) = (1-R^2)\mathrm{Var}(X) = 0.9 \times 1 = 0.9
  ]
* Two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* Power (=80% \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=0.842)

## 2) Core idea (Wald test / Fisher information)

For logistic regression, the (per-subject) Fisher information for (\beta) is
[
I_1 = \mathbb{E}\big[p(X)(1-p(X))X^2\big]
]
where
[
p(X)=\text{logit}^{-1}(\alpha_0 + \beta X),
\quad X\sim N(0,;0.9)
]
and (\alpha_0) is chosen so that (\mathbb{E}[p(X)] = 0.15).

Then the approximate required sample size for testing (H_0:\beta=0) is
[
n \approx \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{\beta^2, I_1}.
]

## 3) Plugging in (numerical expectation under Normal (X))

Solving (\mathbb{E}[p(X)]=0.15) gives an intercept about
[
\alpha_0 \approx -1.839.
]

Evaluating the expectation
[
I_1 = \mathbb{E}\big[p(X)(1-p(X))X^2\big]
]
with (X\sim N(0,0.9)) and (\beta=\log(1.8)) gives
[
I_1 \approx 0.116.
]

Now compute:
[
z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta} = 1.96 + 0.842 = 2.802,
]
[
n \approx \frac{(2.802)^2}{(0.5878)^2 \cdot 0.116}
\approx \frac{7.85}{0.0400}
\approx 196.
]

## Result

**You need about (\boxed{196}) patients total** for **80% power** at **(\alpha=0.05)** to detect **OR = 1.8 per SD** for the biomarker, **given (R^2=0.10)** with the other covariates and **15%** readmission rate.

* Expected readmissions: (0.15 \times 196 \approx 29) events.

## Practical note (model reliability vs power)

You said **5 covariates + the biomarker = 6 predictors**. With ~29 events, that’s about **4.8 events per predictor**, which is often *thin* for stable multivariable logistic regression (even if power for the biomarker is OK). A conservative “events-per-predictor” planning target like 10 would suggest:

* Need (\approx 6\times 10 = 60) events
* With 15% event rate: (N \approx 60/0.15 = 400).

So:

* **Power target for biomarker:** ~**196 total**
* **Stability/estimation target:** often closer to **~400 total** (rule-of-thumb style)

If you tell me whether you’ll use **penalization** (ridge/lasso/Firth) and whether the 5 covariates are prespecified vs selected, I can suggest a more tailored “power + stability” sample size.
