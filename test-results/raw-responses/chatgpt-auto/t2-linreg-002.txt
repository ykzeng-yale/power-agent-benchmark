To test whether **one biomarker** predicts a **continuous severity score** in a simple linear regression, you’re basically testing whether the biomarker’s slope is non-zero (equivalently, whether the model (R^2>0)).

### 1) Translate “explains 15% of the variance” into an effect size

You’re given:
[
R^2 = 0.15
]

For regression power calculations, a common effect size is **Cohen’s (f^2)**:
[
f^2 = \frac{R^2}{1-R^2} = \frac{0.15}{0.85} = 0.17647
]

### 2) Use the F-test framework for (R^2) with 1 predictor

With **one predictor** ((u=1)) and an intercept, the test uses:

* Numerator df: (\text{df}_1 = 1)
* Denominator df: (\text{df}_2 = N - 2)

We choose (N) so that power is 90% for a **two-sided** (\alpha=0.05).

### 3) Result (minimum (N))

Solving for (N) gives:

* **(N = 62)** total patients (since (N=61) is just under 90% power)

A quick check:

* (N=61 \Rightarrow) power (\approx 0.897)
* **(N=62 \Rightarrow) power (\approx 0.902)**

✅ **Answer: You need about 62 patients total.**

### Practical note

If you expect missingness/attrition, inflate:
[
N_{\text{enroll}}=\frac{62}{1-\text{dropout rate}}
]
Example: 10% dropout (\Rightarrow 62/0.9 \approx 69) → enroll **~70**.

If your severity outcome is not approximately continuous/normal (e.g., ordinal, highly skewed, zero-inflated), tell me the outcome type and I’ll adapt the power approach.
