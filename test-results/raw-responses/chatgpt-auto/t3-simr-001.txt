Assuming your mixed model is a **random-intercept-only** linear mixed model and the **treatment effect is a constant mean difference** between groups across the 5 measurements (i.e., no treatment×time interaction), you can approximate power by noting that the treatment effect is estimated off **between-subject information**, while the **residual noise averages down** across repeated measures.

### 1) Convert the 5 repeated measures into an “effective” per-subject outcome

With random intercept SD ( \sigma_b = 0.8) and residual SD ( \sigma_e = 1.0), and (m=5) measurements/subject:

* Random-intercept variance: (\sigma_b^2 = 0.8^2 = 0.64)
* Residual variance: (\sigma_e^2 = 1.0^2 = 1.00)

The variance of a subject’s *mean* over (m) repeated measures is:
[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar{Y}_i) ;=; \sigma_b^2 + \frac{\sigma_e^2}{m}
;=; 0.64 + \frac{1.00}{5}
;=; 0.64 + 0.20
;=; 0.84
]
So the SD of the subject mean is:
[
\sqrt{0.84} \approx 0.9165
]

Your treatment effect is (\Delta = 0.5), so the implied standardized effect on the subject-mean scale is:
[
d_{\text{eff}} = \frac{0.5}{0.9165} \approx 0.545
]

### 2) Two-sample comparison on that per-subject mean scale

With equal group sizes (n) per group, the SE of the difference in means is:
[
SE(\hat{\Delta}) = \sqrt{\frac{2,\mathrm{Var}(\bar{Y}_i)}{n}}
= \sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 0.84}{n}}
]

Using the usual normal approximation for **80% power** and **two-sided (\alpha=0.05)**:

* (z_{1-\alpha/2} \approx 1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.80} \approx 0.842)

Sample size per group:
[
n \approx \frac{2\cdot 0.84 \cdot (1.96 + 0.842)^2}{0.5^2}
\approx 52.74
]

### Answer

**Round up: (\boxed{53 \text{ subjects per group}})** (about **106 total**).

### Quick note (when this would change)

This estimate is for a **main treatment effect** (constant shift). If you actually care about a **treatment×time interaction**, or you expect dropout/unequal spacing, the required (n) can be meaningfully larger.
