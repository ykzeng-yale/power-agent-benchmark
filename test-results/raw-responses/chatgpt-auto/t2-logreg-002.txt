You can treat this as testing the slope in a logistic model with a **standardized** continuous exposure:

[
\text{logit}{P(Y=1\mid X)}= \alpha + \beta X,\qquad X \sim N(0,1)
]

### 1) Translate the effect size to the logistic slope

You expect an odds ratio of **1.5 per 1 SD** increase, so

[
\beta = \log(1.5)=0.4055
]

### 2) What the “baseline disease risk = 10%” is doing here

If “baseline risk” means **risk at the mean exposure** (i.e., at (X=0)):

[
P(Y=1\mid X=0)=0.10 \Rightarrow \alpha = \text{logit}(0.10)=\log\left(\frac{0.10}{0.90}\right)=-2.1972
]

### 3) Information-based sample size for a continuous predictor

For testing (H_0:\beta=0) (Wald test), an accurate planning approximation is:

[
N \approx \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\text{power}})^2}{\beta^2 ; \mathbb{E}\left[p(X){1-p(X)}X^2\right]}
]

where (p(X)=\text{logit}^{-1}(\alpha+\beta X)).

* Two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* Power (=0.80 \Rightarrow z_{1-\text{power}}=0.842)
* ((1.96+0.842)^2 = 7.85)

With (\alpha=-2.1972) and (\beta=0.4055), the expectation
(\mathbb{E}[p(1-p)X^2]) (averaging over (X\sim N(0,1))) is about **0.099**.

So:

[
N \approx \frac{7.85}{(0.4055)^2 \times 0.099}
= \frac{7.85}{0.1644 \times 0.099}
\approx \frac{7.85}{0.0163}
\approx 482
]

✅ **If your sample reflects the population prevalence (~10% cases), you need about *482 total subjects*** (≈48 cases, 434 controls).

## But you said “case-control”: you can sample far more cases than 10%

In an *unmatched case-control* design you typically choose the case:control ratio (often 1:1, 1:2, 1:3). The variance is driven by the fraction of cases in your *sample*, not the population prevalence. Using the same information approach but with common case fractions:

* **1:1 (50% cases):** (N \approx 214) → **~215 total** (**~108 cases + 108 controls**)
* **1:2 (33% cases):** (N \approx 234) → **~234 total** (**~78 cases + 156 controls**)
* **1:3 (25% cases):** (N \approx 268) → **~268 total** (**~67 cases + 201 controls**)

Rule of thumb: **1:1 is most efficient**; adding more controls helps, but with diminishing returns.

---

## Bottom line

* If you truly can do a **case-control sample** and you’re free to choose the ratio, a strong default is **1:1**, needing **~215 total subjects (≈108 cases, 108 controls)**.
* If instead you’re sampling in a way that preserves the **10% prevalence**, you’ll need **~482 total**.

If you tell me your planned **case:control ratio** (or whether it’s matched), I can lock the final number to your exact design.
