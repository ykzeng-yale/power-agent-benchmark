Treating this as a 3-arm, equal-sized, one-way ANOVA (omnibus) test with common SD = 20 mg/dL and expected mean LDL reductions of 10, 20, 25 mg/dL:

Overall mean = (10+20+25)/3 = 18.33

SD of the group means around the overall mean
σm=(10−18.33)2+(20−18.33)2+(25−18.33)23≈6.24\sigma_m = \sqrt{\frac{(10-18.33)^2+(20-18.33)^2+(25-18.33)^2}{3}} \approx 6.24

Cohen’s ANOVA effect size
f=σm/σ=6.24/20≈0.312f = \sigma_m/\sigma = 6.24/20 \approx 0.312

Using α = 0.05 and 80% power for the ANOVA F-test gives:
≈ 103 participants per diet group (total ≈ 309).
If you expect dropouts, you’d typically inflate that (e.g., ~110/group for ~7% attrition).
