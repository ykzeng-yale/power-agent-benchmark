For a Cox proportional hazards model, a standard quick planning formula is **Schoenfeld’s** event-based calculation.

### 1) Events needed (Schoenfeld)

For testing a single continuous biomarker (Wald test) with a log-hazard ratio ( \beta = \log(HR) ),

[
D ;=; \frac{\left(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta}\right)^2}{\left(\log(HR)\right)^2 , \mathrm{Var}(X)}
]

You gave **HR = 1.3 per 1 SD increase**, so if you scale the biomarker to SD units, (\mathrm{Var}(X)=1).

* Two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* Power (=80% \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=0.842)
* (\log(HR)=\log(1.3)=0.2624)

So

[
D \approx \frac{(1.96+0.842)^2}{0.2624^2}
= \frac{2.802^2}{0.0688}
\approx \frac{7.85}{0.0688}
\approx 114 \text{ events.}
]

### 2) Convert events to total sample size

If about **25%** experience the event during follow-up, (D \approx 0.25N). Thus:

[
N ;=; \frac{D}{0.25} ;\approx; \frac{114}{0.25} ;=; 456
]

### Answer

* **Required events:** ~**114**
* **Required total patients:** ~**456** → round up to **457 patients**

Practical note: if you expect dropouts, missing biomarker values, or effect attenuation from measurement error, it’s common to inflate this by ~5–15% (so roughly **480–525**), but the core calculation lands at **~457**.
