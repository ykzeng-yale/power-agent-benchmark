Assume counts follow a **negative binomial (NB2)** model with mean (\mu) and overdispersion parameter (k), so

[
\mathrm{Var}(Y)=\mu+\frac{\mu^2}{k}.
]

You have:

* Control mean (\mu_0 = 5)
* Treatment mean (\mu_1 = 4)
* Dispersion (k = 2)
* Two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (1-\beta=0.80)
* Equal allocation (n) per group, equal follow-up/exposure time per subject

## Approximate two-sample NB sample size (log mean ratio test)

A common planning approximation uses the log mean ratio (\log(\mu_1/\mu_0)). Using the delta method:

* For group (g), (\mathrm{Var}(\bar Y_g)=\dfrac{\mu_g+\mu_g^2/k}{n})
* Then (\mathrm{Var}(\log \bar Y_g)\approx \dfrac{\mathrm{Var}(\bar Y_g)}{\mu_g^2}=\dfrac{1/\mu_g+1/k}{n})

So for the difference in log means:

[
\mathrm{Var}\left(\log\mu_1-\log\mu_0\right)\approx
\frac{1/\mu_1+1/\mu_0+2/k}{n}.
]

Effect size on the log scale:

[
\Delta=\log\left(\frac{\mu_1}{\mu_0}\right)=\log(4/5)=\log(0.8)=-0.2231.
]

With two-sided (\alpha=0.05): (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96), and for 80% power: (z_{1-\beta}=0.84).

Required (n) per group:

[
n \approx
\frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2\left(\frac{1}{\mu_1}+\frac{1}{\mu_0}+\frac{2}{k}\right)}{\Delta^2}.
]

Plug in:

* (\frac{1}{\mu_1}+\frac{1}{\mu_0}+\frac{2}{k}=\frac14+\frac15+\frac{2}{2}=0.25+0.20+1.00=1.45)
* ((1.96+0.84)^2 = 2.80^2 = 7.84)
* (\Delta^2 = 0.2231^2 \approx 0.0498)

[
n \approx \frac{7.84 \times 1.45}{0.0498} \approx 228.3
]

## Answer

**About (\boxed{229}) participants per group** (rounding up), so **total (N \approx 458)**.

### Notes (things that can change this)

* If your test is **one-sided**, (n) drops (replace (1.96) with (1.645)).
* If follow-up time differs, you’d plan on **rates** with an offset; the same structure applies but with (\mu) as the expected count per subject-time.
* If (k) is smaller (more overdispersion), required (n) increases quickly.

If you tell me whether this is **two-sided vs one-sided**, and whether everyone has **the same exposure time**, I can give the exact recalculation for that setup.
