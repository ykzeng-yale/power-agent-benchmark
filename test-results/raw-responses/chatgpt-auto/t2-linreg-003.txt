To test whether the **3 added genetic markers** improve prediction beyond your **4 existing predictors**, you typically use a **partial (incremental) F-test** for the change in (R^2):

* Reduced model: (p_R = 4) predictors, (R^2_R = 0.20)
* Full model: (p_F = 7) predictors, (R^2_F = 0.30)
* Tested block size: (u = p_F - p_R = 3)
* (\alpha = 0.05) (two-sided for the F-test), power (= 0.80)

## 1) Convert the incremental (R^2) to an effect size (partial (f^2))

For testing a block of predictors, Cohen’s partial effect size is

[
f^2 ;=;\frac{R^2_F - R^2_R}{1 - R^2_F}
]

Plug in:

[
f^2 = \frac{0.30 - 0.20}{1 - 0.30}
= \frac{0.10}{0.70}
= 0.142857
]

## 2) Power model for the partial F-test

The partial F-test has:

* Numerator df: (\text{df}_1 = u = 3)
* Denominator df: (\text{df}_2 = v = N - p_F - 1 = N - 8)

The noncentrality parameter for the test is

[
\lambda = f^2 \cdot v = f^2 \cdot (N - 8)
]

Power is computed as:

[
\text{Power} = P\left(F_{u,v,\lambda} > F_{\text{crit}} \right),
\quad F_{\text{crit}} = F^{-1}_{u,v}(1-\alpha)
]

## 3) Solve for the smallest (N) giving 80% power

Numerically solving this gives:

* **Minimum (N = 89)** total subjects

Check at (N=89):

* (v = 89 - 8 = 81)
* (\lambda = 0.142857 \times 81 \approx 11.57)
* Power (\approx 0.805)

At (N=88), power is just under 0.80 ((\approx 0.799)), so **89 is the first integer that clears 80%**.

## Recommendation

* **Plan for ~89 subjects total** to detect the increase from (R^2=0.20) to (R^2=0.30) when adding 3 markers (with 80% power, (\alpha=0.05)).
* In practice, you’d often round up (e.g., **90–100**) to cover missing data / QC failures for genetic markers.

If you tell me an expected missingness rate (e.g., 10% genotyping failure or unusable outcomes), I can inflate the 89 accordingly.
