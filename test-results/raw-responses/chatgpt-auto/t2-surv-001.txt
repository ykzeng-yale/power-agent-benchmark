Using the standard **log-rank (Schoenfeld/Freedman) approximation**, the sample size is driven by the **number of events** needed, then we “inflate” to total N based on how many events we expect to observe given accrual + follow-up.

## 1) Required number of events

For equal allocation (1:1), the required total number of events is

[
D ;=; \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{(\log HR)^2 , p(1-p)}
\quad\text{with }p=0.5
]

* Two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* Power (=80% \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=0.84)
* (HR=0.7 \Rightarrow \log(HR)=\log(0.7)=-0.3567)
* (p(1-p)=0.25)

[
D \approx \frac{(1.96+0.84)^2}{(0.3567)^2 \cdot 0.25}
\approx 246.8
]

So you need about **247 events total**.

## 2) Convert events to total N using the study calendar

Assume **exponential survival** and **uniform accrual** over 3 years, plus **2 additional years** follow-up (so study ends at 5 years from start).

Control median = 2 years ⇒ control hazard
[
\lambda_c=\frac{\ln 2}{2}=0.3466 ;\text{per year}
]
Treatment hazard (\lambda_t = 0.7\lambda_c = 0.2426).

A subject enrolled at time (u\in[0,3]) is followed for (T=5-u\in[2,5]) years. Under exponential survival, event prob by time (T) is (1-e^{-\lambda T}). Averaging over uniform accrual gives mean event probability in an arm:

[
\bar{E}(\lambda) = 1 - \frac{1}{3}\int_{2}^{5} e^{-\lambda s},ds
= 1 - \frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{e^{-2\lambda}-e^{-5\lambda}}{\lambda}
]

Plugging in:

* Control: (\bar{E}_c \approx 0.689)
* Treatment: (\bar{E}_t \approx 0.563)

With 1:1 allocation, overall expected event fraction:
[
\bar{E} = \frac{\bar{E}_c+\bar{E}_t}{2} \approx \frac{0.689+0.563}{2}=0.626
]

So total N needed:
[
N \approx \frac{D}{\bar{E}} \approx \frac{246.8}{0.626} \approx 394.4
]

## Answer

**About 198 patients per arm** (≈ **396 total**) for **80% power** at **two-sided (\alpha=0.05)**, assuming:

* log-rank test / proportional hazards,
* exponential survival consistent with the given median,
* uniform accrual over 3 years,
* no loss to follow-up/noncompliance.

If you expect dropout or non-informative censoring beyond the design, inflate by dividing by the expected retention (e.g., 10% lost ⇒ (198/0.9 \approx 220) per arm).
