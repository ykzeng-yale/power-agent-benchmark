Here’s a workable **log-rank–type approximation** for a **mixture-cure** setting (cured = no event), assuming:

* Equal randomization (1:1)
* Only administrative censoring
* Two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (=80%)

## 1) Translate inputs into model pieces

**Cure fractions**

* Control: (\pi_C=0.30) (cured), so (1-\pi_C=0.70) uncured
* Treatment: (\pi_T=0.45) (cured), so (1-\pi_T=0.55) uncured

**Among uncured** (assume exponential for planning):

* Control median (=2) years (\Rightarrow \lambda_C=\ln(2)/2=0.3466) per year
* HR among uncured (=0.8 \Rightarrow \lambda_T=0.8\lambda_C=0.2773)

**Mixture survival in arm (g\in{C,T}):**
[
S_g(t)=\pi_g + (1-\pi_g)e^{-\lambda_g t},
\quad
f_g(t)=(1-\pi_g)\lambda_g e^{-\lambda_g t}.
]

## 2) How many events by 5 years? (sanity check)

Uncured event probability by 5 years under exponential:

* Control uncured:
  [
  1-e^{-\lambda_C 5}=1-e^{-0.3466\cdot 5}=1-e^{-1.733}=0.824
  ]
  Overall control event prob:
  [
  P(\text{event}|C)=0.70\times 0.824=0.577
  ]

* Treatment uncured:
  [
  1-e^{-\lambda_T 5}=1-e^{-0.2773\cdot 5}=1-e^{-1.386}=0.750
  ]
  Overall treatment event prob:
  [
  P(\text{event}|T)=0.55\times 0.750=0.413
  ]

So over 5 years you expect **~57.7%** events in control vs **~41.3%** in treatment (big separation mainly from the cure fraction increase).

## 3) Sample size (log-rank approximation under non-PH)

Because cure makes hazards **non-proportional**, a simple Schoenfeld “single HR” isn’t strictly correct. A standard workaround for planning is to compute the **expected log-rank mean/variance** under the specified mixture curves (administrative censoring at 5y), then solve:
[
\frac{(\mathbb{E}[U])^2}{\mathrm{Var}(U)} = (z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2.
]

Doing that integral numerically for your parameters gives:

* **Total (N \approx 280)**
* **Per arm (\approx 140)**

### Sensitivity to accrual (if “5-year follow-up” means total study duration)

If instead you have **uniform accrual over 2 years** and study ends at year 5 (so follow-up ranges 3–5 years), required (N) rises modestly to about:

* **Total (N \approx 310)**
* **Per arm (\approx 155)**

## Answer

* If each subject is followed **a full 5 years**: **~140 per arm**.
* If study is **5 years total with ~2 years accrual**: **~155 per arm**.

(Then inflate for loss-to-follow-up/nonadherence if you expect it.)
