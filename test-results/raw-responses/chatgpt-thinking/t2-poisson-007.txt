Assuming **equal follow-up of 1 person-year per subject** and a **two-sided α = 0.05**, you have:

* Clusters per arm: (K=20)
* Subjects per cluster: (m=25)  (\Rightarrow) person-time per arm (T = K m = 500) PY
* Baseline rate: (\lambda_0 = 4) events/PY  (\Rightarrow) expected events in control (D_0=\lambda_0 T = 2000)
* Target rate ratio: (RR=1.25)  (\Rightarrow) expected events in treatment (D_1=RR\cdot D_0 = 2500)

### 1) Individual-level (Poisson) information for log rate ratio

For comparing two Poisson rates with equal person-time,
[
\mathrm{Var}\big(\log \widehat{RR}\big)\approx \frac{1}{D_0}+\frac{1}{D_1}
]
So
[
\mathrm{Var}\approx \frac{1}{2000}+\frac{1}{2500}=0.0009
]

### 2) Inflate for clustering via design effect

Using the usual cluster design effect
[
DE = 1+(m-1)\rho = 1+24(0.03)=1.72
]
[
\mathrm{Var}_c \approx 0.0009\times 1.72=0.001548
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
SE=\sqrt{0.001548}=0.03934
]

### 3) Power for two-sided test of (\log(RR))

Effect on log scale: (\delta=\log(1.25)=0.2231)

Mean Z under alternative:
[
Z_{\text{mean}}=\frac{\delta}{SE}=\frac{0.2231}{0.03934}=5.67
]
With (z_{0.975}=1.96),
[
\text{Power} \approx P(|Z|>1.96 \mid Z\sim N(5.67,1)) \approx 0.99990
]

## **Answer**

Under the (common) assumption of **1 PY follow-up per subject**, the design achieves **~99.99% power** at **α = 0.05 (two-sided)** to detect **RR = 1.25**.

### Quick sensitivity to follow-up time (since it wasn’t specified)

If average follow-up were shorter, power drops because expected events drop:

* **0.5 PY/subject:** ~**98.0%**
* **0.25 PY/subject:** ~**80.9%**
* **0.1 PY/subject:** ~**43.4%**

If you tell me the **average follow-up (PY per subject)** you expect, I can lock this down to your exact setting.
