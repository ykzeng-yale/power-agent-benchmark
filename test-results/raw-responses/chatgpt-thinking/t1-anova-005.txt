Assuming you’re powering a **one-way ANOVA across 6 centers** (i.e., **6 groups**, balanced) with Cohen’s **(f=0.40)**, **(\alpha=0.01)**, and **95% power**, the per-center sample size comes from the noncentral **F** test:

* Numerator df: (k-1 = 6-1 = 5)
* Denominator df: (N-k)
* Noncentrality: (\lambda = f^2 , N)

Solving for (N) to achieve 95% power at (\alpha=0.01) gives:

* **Required (n) per center ≈ 168.67 → round up to 169**
* **Total (N = 6 \times 169 = 1{,}014)**

✅ **Answer: 169 subjects per center (≈ 1,014 total).**

If this is truly a *multi-center trial* with outcomes correlated within center (ICC) or you’re fitting a mixed model with center as a random effect, you’d typically inflate above this; but under the standard fixed-effects one-way ANOVA assumption, **169/center** is the target.
