For a **two-sample comparison of means** (treatment vs control), equal group sizes, using Cohen’s (d), a common planning formula is:

[
n_{\text{per group}} \approx \frac{2\left(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}\right)^2}{d^2}
]

Given:

* (d = 0.5)
* (\alpha = 0.05) (two-sided) (\Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \approx 1.96)
* Power (= 0.80 \Rightarrow \beta = 0.20 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.80} \approx 0.84)

Compute:

1. Add z’s: (1.96 + 0.84 = 2.80)
2. Square: (2.80^2 = 7.84)
3. Multiply by 2: (2 \times 7.84 = 15.68)
4. Divide by (d^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25):
   [
   n \approx \frac{15.68}{0.25} = 62.72
   ]

Round up:

✅ **You need about *63 participants per group*** (so **126 total**).

(If you want to be slightly conservative for the t-distribution vs z-approximation, many people round this to **64 per group**.)
