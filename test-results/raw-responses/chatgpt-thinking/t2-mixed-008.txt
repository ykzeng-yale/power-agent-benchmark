If you only power for the **primary outcome**, the “2 correlated outcomes (r=0.6)” piece doesn’t affect the sample size unless you plan to *borrow information* from the secondary outcome (e.g., multivariate mixed model / joint model). Under your statement (“power for primary only”), we can ignore it.

### Step 1: Base two-sample effect size

You gave a standardized treatment effect at a single measurement:

* **Cohen’s d = 0.4**

For a two-sided test with **α = 0.05** and **80% power**:

* (z_{1-\alpha/2} = 1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.80} = 0.84)

The usual per-group sample size for a two-sample comparison is:
[
n_0 ;=; \frac{2,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{d^2}
]
[
n_0 = \frac{2(1.96+0.84)^2}{0.4^2}
= \frac{2(2.80)^2}{0.16}
\approx \frac{15.68}{0.16}
\approx 98.0
]
So **about 99 per group** if you only used **one time point**.

### Step 2: Gain from 3 repeated measures with ICC = 0.5

With **m = 3** equally-informative repeated measures per subject and **within-subject ICC ρ = 0.5**, the variance of a subject’s *mean across time* is:
[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar Y) = \sigma^2 \frac{1+(m-1)\rho}{m}
]
So the **SD** of the subject mean is multiplied by:
[
\sqrt{\frac{1+(m-1)\rho}{m}}
]
That means the *effective* standardized effect size becomes:
[
d_{\text{eff}} = d \sqrt{\frac{m}{1+(m-1)\rho}}
]
Plug in (m=3), (\rho=0.5):
[
\frac{m}{1+(m-1)\rho} = \frac{3}{1+2(0.5)}=\frac{3}{2}=1.5
]
[
d_{\text{eff}} = 0.4\sqrt{1.5} \approx 0.4(1.225) \approx 0.49
]

Now use the same two-sample formula with (d_{\text{eff}}):
[
n = \frac{2(1.96+0.84)^2}{d_{\text{eff}}^2}
= \frac{15.68}{0.49^2}
= \frac{15.68}{0.24}
\approx 65.4
]

### Result

**Round up: (\boxed{66\text{ subjects per group}})** (so **132 total**).

### Important note (when this *wouldn’t* apply)

This 66/group assumes the treatment effect is expressed **consistently across the 3 time points** (or equivalently your analysis efficiently uses all 3 measurements, e.g., mixed model / subject mean).
If instead the effect is **only** at the final time point and earlier measures don’t carry treatment information, you’d be closer to the single-time-point answer (**~99 per group**).

If you tell me whether the effect is “at end only” vs “roughly constant over time,” I can lock in the more appropriate choice—but with the usual “use all time points” assumption, **66/group** is the standard quick calculation.
