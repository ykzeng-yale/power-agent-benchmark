Using Riley’s **criterion (i)** (target **global shrinkage** (S=0.90)) for a prediction model, the required development sample size is: 

[
n ;=; \frac{P}{(S-1),\ln!\left(1-\frac{R^2_{CS}}{S}\right)}
]

For a **continuous outcome**, (R^2_{CS}) is just the usual (R^2). 

Plug in:

* (P = 30)
* (R^2 = 0.35)
* (S = 0.90)

Step-by-step:

* (\frac{R^2}{S} = \frac{0.35}{0.90} = 0.3888889)
* (1 - \frac{R^2}{S} = 0.6111111)
* (\ln(0.6111111) \approx -0.492476)
* ((S-1)\ln(\cdot) = (-0.1)(-0.492476) = 0.0492476)
* (n = 30 / 0.0492476 \approx 609.3)

**Required sample size (rounded up): (\boxed{610}) participants.**

(That’s the minimum to meet the **shrinkage** criterion; the full continuous-outcome Riley approach also checks additional criteria like precision of residual variance and the mean outcome. ([CRAN][1]))
