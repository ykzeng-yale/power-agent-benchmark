Here’s a workable **closed-form approximation** for a repeated binary outcome analyzed with a **random-intercept logistic mixed model** (3 observations/subject). I’ll treat it like a clustered design and use a **design-effect (DE)** based on the random-intercept variance.

## 1) Convert the OR to a treated event probability

Control (baseline) probability: (p_0 = 0.30)
Treatment OR: (OR = 2.0)

Assuming the OR acts on the logit scale:
[
\text{logit}(p_1) = \text{logit}(p_0) + \log(OR)
]
[
p_1 = \frac{1}{1+\exp{-(\text{logit}(0.30)+\log 2)}} \approx 0.4615
]

So we’re comparing **0.30 vs 0.4615**.

## 2) “Independent-observations” sample size (ignoring clustering)

Using the standard 2-sample proportions normal approximation (two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (=80%), 1:1 allocation), the required number of **independent Bernoulli observations** is about:
[
n_{\text{ind, per group}} \approx 141
]

## 3) Compute ICC from the random intercept SD

Random intercept SD = 0.5 ⇒ variance (\sigma_b^2 = 0.25)

For a logistic random-intercept model, a common approximation is:
[
ICC \approx \frac{\sigma_b^2}{\sigma_b^2 + \pi^2/3}
= \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 3.2899} \approx 0.0706
]

## 4) Design effect for (m=3) observations/subject

[
DE = 1 + (m-1),ICC = 1 + 2(0.0706) \approx 1.141
]

Effective independent observations per group from (S) subjects is:
[
n_{\text{eff}} = \frac{S\cdot m}{DE}
]
Set (n_{\text{eff}} \approx 141):
[
S \approx \frac{141\cdot DE}{m} = \frac{141\cdot 1.141}{3} \approx 53.5
]

## Result

**≈ 54 subjects per group** (so **108 total subjects**), under these assumptions.

### Notes (why this is approximate)

* This uses an ICC/design-effect approximation; exact GLMM power depends on how you interpret “baseline probability” (marginal vs conditional) and whether the OR is intended as subject-specific (GLMM) vs population-average (GEE).
* If you want, I can also give a quick **simulation-based power check** for the exact random-intercept logistic model (often shifts the answer by ~5–15% depending on assumptions).
