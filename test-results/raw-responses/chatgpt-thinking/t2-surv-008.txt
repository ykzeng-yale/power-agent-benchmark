For a **stratified log-rank / Cox model with a common HR across strata**, the usual (Freedman/Schoenfeld) approximation says the **number of events needed** depends mainly on the target HR, (\alpha), power, and allocation—not on the different baseline hazards (stratification mainly affects efficiency a bit, but the standard planning approach uses the same event formula).

## 1) Required total number of events

With 1:1 randomization ((p=0.5)), two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (1-\beta=0.80):

[
D ;=; \frac{\left(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}\right)^2}{\left(\log HR\right)^2, p(1-p)}
]

* (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta}=0.84)
* (HR=0.75 \Rightarrow \log(HR)=\log(0.75)=-0.28768)
* (p(1-p)=0.25)

[
D \approx \frac{(1.96+0.84)^2}{(0.28768)^2 \cdot 0.25}
\approx \frac{(2.80)^2}{0.08276 \cdot 0.25}
\approx 379.4
]

So you need about **380 total events**.

## 2) Convert events to sample size using expected event proportion

You gave: over 2 years, **40% of controls have an event**, so (S_C(2)=0.60).

To get the **treatment** 2-year event proportion under (HR=0.75), a common planning approximation assumes exponential survival within arm:

* Control hazard over 2y: ( \lambda_C = -\ln(0.60)/2)
* Treatment hazard: ( \lambda_T = HR\cdot \lambda_C)
* So (S_T(2)=\exp(-\lambda_T\cdot 2)=\exp(-HR\cdot(-\ln 0.60))=0.60^{HR})

[
S_T(2)=0.60^{0.75}\approx 0.6817
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\Pr(\text{event}|T)=1-0.6817\approx 0.3183
]

Average event proportion across both arms:
[
\bar{\pi}=\frac{0.40+0.3183}{2}\approx 0.3591
]

Total sample size:
[
N \approx \frac{D}{\bar{\pi}} \approx \frac{379.4}{0.3591}\approx 1056.7
]

With 1:1 allocation:
[
N_{\text{per arm}} \approx 1056.7/2 \approx 528.4
]

## Answer

**Round up:** **~529 participants per arm** (≈ **1,058 total**).

**Note:** This uses the standard exponential approximation to translate the control 2-year event rate into the treatment 2-year event rate. If you instead (conservatively or simplistically) used **40% as the overall event fraction**, you’d get a smaller estimate (~474/arm), but the ~529/arm is the more internally consistent conversion under (HR=0.75).
