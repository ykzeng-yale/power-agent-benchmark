Using Riley’s **criterion targeting global shrinkage** (so expected calibration slope / shrinkage factor **S** is at least your target), the key relationship is:
[
S \approx 1-\frac{p}{LR}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
LR \approx \frac{p}{1-S}
]
and for a (Gaussian) linear regression model the overall likelihood ratio statistic is well-approximated by
[
LR \approx n ,\ln!\left(\frac{1}{1-R^2}\right)
]
Combining gives the usual closed-form sample size requirement:
[
n \ge \frac{p}{(1-S),\ln!\left(\frac{1}{1-R^2}\right)}
]
(This is the same algebra shown in Riley’s slide derivation for the shrinkage criterion, just written in the rearranged “solve for (n)” form. ([biometrische-gesellschaft.de][1]))

### Plug in your values

* Candidate predictor **parameters**: (p=15) (if you have categoricals/splines, use the *total parameter count*, which may exceed 15 ([R Project Search][2]))
* Anticipated (R^2 = 0.15) (Riley recommends using an *optimism-adjusted* / adjusted (R^2) from prior work as the input ([R Project Search][2]))
* Target shrinkage: (S=0.95) (more conservative than the common 0.90 default ([R Project Search][2]))

Compute:

* (1-R^2 = 0.85)
* (\ln!\left(\frac{1}{0.85}\right)=\ln(1.17647)\approx 0.16252)
* ((1-S)\ln(\cdot) = 0.05\times 0.16252 \approx 0.008126)

[
n \ge \frac{15}{0.008126} \approx 1845.94
]

### Required minimum sample size

**Round up: (\boxed{n \approx 1{,}846}) participants** to target **≤5% shrinkage** (global shrinkage factor **0.95**) given (R^2=0.15) and 15 predictor parameters.

*Note:* Riley’s full continuous-outcome framework also checks additional criteria (e.g., small apparent–adjusted (R^2) difference, precision of residual SD, precision of mean outcome ([R Project Search][2])). With your standardized outcome (mean 0, SD 1), those typically won’t exceed the shrinkage-driven requirement here—so **~1,846** is very likely the governing minimum.
