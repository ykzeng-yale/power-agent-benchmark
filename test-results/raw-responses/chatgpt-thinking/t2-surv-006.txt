Using a **mixture cure model** with **administrative censoring at 5 years**:

* Control cure fraction (p_C=0.30); treatment cure fraction (p_T=0.45).
* Among the **non-cured**, assume **exponential** survival.

  * Control median (=2) years (\Rightarrow \lambda_C=\ln(2)/2=0.3466) per year
  * Treatment “uncured” hazard ratio (=0.8) (\Rightarrow \lambda_T=0.8\lambda_C=0.2773) per year
* Everyone is followed for **5 years** (no staggered accrual assumed).
* Primary test: **two-sided log-rank**, (\alpha=0.05), power (=80%).

### What this implies about event fractions by 5 years

Event probability by 5 years is
[
P(\text{event by }5)= (1-p_{\text{cure}})\left(1-e^{-\lambda\cdot 5}\right).
]

* Control:
  [
  (1-0.30)\left(1-e^{-0.3466\cdot 5}\right)=0.70(1-e^{-1.733})\approx 0.576.
  ]
* Treatment:
  [
  (1-0.45)\left(1-e^{-0.2773\cdot 5}\right)=0.55(1-e^{-1.386})\approx 0.4125.
  ]

So with 5-year follow-up you’d expect roughly **57.6% events** in control vs **41.3% events** in treatment.

### Sample size (simulation-based log-rank power under this cure setup)

Because the overall hazards are **not proportional** (the cure fraction difference creates time-varying hazards), the usual “PH-only” Schoenfeld calculation isn’t reliable. A straightforward way is to compute power for the **log-rank test** under the stated cure-mixture data-generating process.

Under the assumptions above, the per-arm size that lands at ~80% power is:

* **≈ 140 patients per arm** (≈ **280 total**)

### Practical adjustment

If you expect loss to follow-up / non-informative dropout, inflate. For example, **10%** attrition:
[
140 / 0.90 \approx 156 \text{ per arm}.
]

### Notes on sensitivity

* **Staggered accrual** (not everyone observed a full 5 years) would generally **reduce the number of observed events**, so you’d need **more** than 140/arm.
* If the “uncured” survival is less exponential-like (e.g., heavy early deaths), power can shift; cure-fraction separation still tends to dominate here.

**Answer:** **~140 per arm** for 80% power at two-sided (\alpha=0.05) (with full 5-year follow-up); consider **~155–160 per arm** if you want to cover ~10% attrition.
