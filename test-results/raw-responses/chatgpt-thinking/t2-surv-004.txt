We can do this with the standard **log-rank / Schoenfeld** approach:

## 1) Events needed (log-rank; equal allocation)

For equal randomization (50/50), the required total number of observed events is

[
D ;=; \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{(\log HR)^2;p(1-p)}
\quad\text{with}\quad p=0.5
]

* Two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.960)
* Power (=0.85 \Rightarrow \beta=0.15 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=1.036)
* (HR=0.75 \Rightarrow \log(HR)=\log(0.75)=-0.28768)
* (p(1-p)=0.25)

[
D=\frac{(1.960+1.036)^2}{(0.28768)^2 \cdot 0.25}
\approx \frac{(2.996)^2}{0.08276\cdot 0.25}
\approx \frac{8.976}{0.02069}
\approx 434
]

**Required events: ~434 total events.**

## 2) Convert events to sample size using your accrual + follow-up

You gave:

* Control 1-year survival (S_c(12)=0.70)
* Accrual = 18 months, additional follow-up = 12 months
  → study ends at 30 months; a participant enrolled at month (u\in[0,18]) has administrative follow-up (T=30-u\in[12,30]).

Assume **exponential survival** (common planning assumption):
[
\lambda_c = -\frac{\log(0.70)}{12} = 0.02972\ \text{per month}
]
[
\lambda_t = HR\cdot \lambda_c = 0.75\times 0.02972 = 0.02229
]

For a subject with follow-up time (T), event probability is (1-e^{-\lambda T}). Averaging over uniform accrual (so (T\sim \text{Unif}(12,30))):

* Control average event probability (\bar p_c \approx 0.458)
* Treatment average event probability (\bar p_t \approx 0.370)

Average across arms:
[
\bar p = (\bar p_c+\bar p_t)/2 \approx 0.414
]

So expected total events (\approx N_{\text{total}}\cdot 0.414). Set equal to 434:

[
N_{\text{total}} \approx \frac{434}{0.414} \approx 1049
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
n \approx 524 \text{ per arm (before dropout)}
]

---

## 3) Account for 20% dropout

A common planning adjustment is to **inflate sample size by (1/(1-d))**:

[
n_{\text{adj}} = \frac{524}{0.80} \approx 655.5
]

### ✅ Final (rounded up)

**≈ 656 patients per arm** (≈ **1,312 total**) to achieve 85% power at two-sided α = 0.05, **accounting for 20% dropout**.

---

If you want, I can also compute the sample size under a *more explicit dropout model* (e.g., exponential loss-to-follow-up competing with event + admin censoring), which can shift the number a bit depending on what “20% dropout” means operationally (by end of study vs over 12 months, etc.).
