For a 4-period **replicate crossover** (ABAB / BABA), each subject receives **A twice** and **B twice**, so you can form a within-subject treatment contrast

[
D_i=\bar{Y}*{iA}-\bar{Y}*{iB}=\frac{(Y_{i,A1}+Y_{i,A2})}{2}-\frac{(Y_{i,B1}+Y_{i,B2})}{2}.
]

If the **within-subject SD per period** is (\sigma_w) and (standard assumption) the period residuals are independent with variance (\sigma_w^2), then

[
\mathrm{Var}(D_i)=\sigma_w^2\left(\tfrac14+\tfrac14\right)=\frac{\sigma_w^2}{2}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\mathrm{SD}(D_i)=\frac{\sigma_w}{\sqrt{2}}.
]

You defined (d=\Delta/\sigma_w) (mean difference divided by within-subject SD), so the standardized effect **on the contrast scale** is

[
\frac{\Delta}{\sigma_w/\sqrt{2}} = d\sqrt{2}.
]

Treating this as a one-sample (or paired) t-test on (D_i), the usual normal-approx sample size is:

[
n \approx \left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{d\sqrt{2}}\right)^2.
]

Plug in: (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{0.975}=1.960), power (=0.85 \Rightarrow z_{0.85}=1.036), (d=0.35):

[
n \approx \left(\frac{1.960+1.036}{0.35\sqrt{2}}\right)^2
= \left(\frac{2.996}{0.495}\right)^2
\approx 36.65.
]

So you need **37 subjects total** by this approximation.

Because you’ll typically balance sequences (ABAB vs BABA), round up to an even total:

* **Total N = 38** (≈ **19 per sequence**)

**Notes (why this could differ in practice):** this assumes no extra correlation structure beyond a subject effect and uses a large-sample z approximation (t-based would be very close here). If you’re actually doing **bioequivalence via TOST** on log(PK) with a CI criterion, the calculation is usually framed in terms of the BE limits and within-subject CV; the required N can differ.
