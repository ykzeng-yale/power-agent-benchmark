In a standard **2×2 crossover (AB/BA)** analyzed via the **within-subject treatment difference** (i.e., each subject contributes one paired difference), the primary test is essentially a **paired t-test** on those within-subject differences.

Let

* (d = \dfrac{\Delta}{\sigma_w}) = standardized **within-subject** effect (you gave (d=0.3))
* two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=z_{0.975}=1.96)
* power (=0.90 \Rightarrow \beta=0.10 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.90}=1.2816)

Approximate required **number of subjects**:
[
n ;\approx; \left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{d}\right)^2
= \left(\frac{1.96+1.2816}{0.3}\right)^2
= \left(\frac{3.2416}{0.3}\right)^2
= (10.805)^2
\approx 116.8
]

So you need **(n = 117) subjects total** (round up).

**Answer: ~117 total subjects (about 58–59 per sequence).**

Notes (so you know what this assumes): no dropout, no strong period/carryover effects, and analysis based on within-subject differences (or an equivalent linear model). If you expect dropout, inflate by (n/(1-\text{dropout})). For example, 10% dropout → (117/0.9 \approx 130) subjects.
