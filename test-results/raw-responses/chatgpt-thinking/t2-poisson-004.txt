You can treat this as a **two-arm Poisson rate comparison** with an offset for follow-up time. With equal allocation and (on average) the same follow-up distribution in both arms, the Wald test for (\log(\text{RR})) gives a clean closed form.

### 1) Set up expected event counts per arm

* Control rate: (\lambda_0 = 3) per year
* Target rate ratio: (\text{RR}=1.4 \Rightarrow \lambda_1 = 3\times 1.4 = 4.2) per year
* Mean follow-up time: (\mu_T = E(T)=0.8) years

With (n) subjects per arm:
[
D_0 = n,\mu_T,\lambda_0,\qquad D_1 = n,\mu_T,\lambda_1
]

### 2) Approximate variance of (\log(\widehat{\text{RR}}))

For Poisson counts,
[
\operatorname{Var}\big(\log(\widehat{\text{RR}})\big)\approx \frac{1}{D_0}+\frac{1}{D_1}
= \frac{1}{n\mu_T}\left(\frac{1}{\lambda_0}+\frac{1}{\lambda_1}\right)
]

### 3) Solve for (n)

Two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
Power (80% \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=0.84)

Requirement:
[
\frac{\big(\log(\text{RR})\big)^2}{\operatorname{Var}} \ge (z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2
]
So,
[
n ;\ge; \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2\left(\frac{1}{\lambda_0}+\frac{1}{\lambda_1}\right)}
{\mu_T\big(\log(\text{RR})\big)^2}
]

Plug in:

* (\log(1.4)=0.33647), so ((\log(1.4))^2=0.1132)
* (\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4.2}=0.3333+0.2381=0.5714)
* ((1.96+0.84)^2=(2.80)^2=7.84)

[
n \ge \frac{7.84\times 0.5714}{0.8\times 0.1132}
= \frac{4.48}{0.09056}
\approx 49.5
]

### Result

**≈ 50 subjects per group** (≈ 100 total) for **80% power** at **two-sided (\alpha=0.05)**.

Sanity check (expected events):

* Per subject: control (3\times 0.8=2.4) events, treatment (4.2\times 0.8=3.36) events
* With (n=50): (D_0\approx120) and (D_1\approx168) expected events

*Note:* the follow-up **SD (0.3 years)** doesn’t materially change this Poisson-information calculation as long as follow-up is correctly used as an offset and the **mean follow-up** is 0.8 in each arm. If you expect **overdispersion** (negative binomial / extra-Poisson variability), you’d inflate (n) by the dispersion factor.
