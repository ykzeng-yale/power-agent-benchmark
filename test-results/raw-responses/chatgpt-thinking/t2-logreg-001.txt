Because the exposure is binary and present in **50%**, this is equivalent to planning a **2-group comparison of proportions** (exposed vs unexposed) under the assumed odds ratio.

### 1) Convert the OR to an event rate in the exposed group

Unexposed risk: (p_0=0.20) so unexposed odds:
[
\text{odds}_0=\frac{p_0}{1-p_0}=\frac{0.20}{0.80}=0.25
]
Assumed OR = 2.0, so exposed odds:
[
\text{odds}_1 = 2.0 \times 0.25 = 0.50
]
Convert back to probability:
[
p_1=\frac{\text{odds}_1}{1+\text{odds}_1}=\frac{0.50}{1.50}=0.3333
]

So you’re powering for **20% vs 33.3%** disease risk.

### 2) Sample size for two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (=0.80), equal groups

Using the standard normal approximation for two independent proportions with equal allocation:
[
n_{\text{per group}}=
\frac{\left[z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{2\bar p(1-\bar p)} + z_{1-\beta}\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)+p_1(1-p_1)}\right]^2}{(p_1-p_0)^2}
]
where (\bar p=(p_0+p_1)/2).

Plugging in:

* (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.80}=0.84)
* (p_0=0.20,; p_1=0.3333,; \bar p=0.2667)

gives:

* (n_{\text{per group}} \approx 171.5 \Rightarrow 172) per group

### ✅ Answer

* **Total sample size ≈ 344 patients** (about **172 exposed** and **172 unexposed**).

If you expect dropout/missing outcome data, inflate: e.g., 10% loss → (344/0.90 \approx 382) total.
