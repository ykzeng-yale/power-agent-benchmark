We can treat this as a **two‐arm Poisson rate comparison** (or equivalently, a log–rate Poisson regression with an offset for person‐time), where the treatment has a constant **rate ratio (RR) = 0.8** over follow-up.

## 1) Expected events per person over 3 years

You said the control event rate is **1 event/person-year at time 0** and increases by **10% per year**.

A convenient model is a smooth exponential increase:
[
\lambda_C(t)=\lambda_0 , e^{\beta t},\quad \lambda_0=1,\ \beta=\ln(1.1)
]
Then the expected number of events per person over (T=3) years is
[
\mu_C=\int_0^3 \lambda_C(t),dt=\int_0^3 e^{\beta t},dt
=\frac{e^{3\beta}-1}{\beta}
=\frac{1.1^3-1}{\ln(1.1)}
\approx \frac{1.331-1}{0.09531}\approx 3.473
]
Treatment reduces the rate by RR = 0.8, so
[
\mu_T = 0.8,\mu_C \approx 0.8\times 3.473 \approx 2.778
]

## 2) Sample size from the log rate ratio test

With equal allocation (n) per group, expected total events are
[
E_C=n\mu_C,\quad E_T=n\mu_T
]
For a Wald test of (\log(RR)), an often-used approximation is
[
\mathrm{Var}{\log(\widehat{RR})}\approx \frac{1}{E_C}+\frac{1}{E_T}
=\frac{1}{n}\left(\frac{1}{\mu_C}+\frac{1}{\mu_T}\right)
]
Power requirement (two-sided (\alpha=0.05), 80% power):
[
\frac{|\log(RR)|}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}}} \ge z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}
]
So
[
n \ge
\frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2\left(\frac{1}{\mu_C}+\frac{1}{\mu_T}\right)}
{{\log(0.8)}^2}
]
Using (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96), (z_{1-\beta}=0.842), (\mu_C=3.473), (\mu_T=2.778):
[
n \approx 102.13 \ \Rightarrow\ \boxed{103\ \text{per group}}
]

## Practical note (stepwise yearly increase interpretation)

If you instead interpret “+10% each year” as piecewise constant by year:

* Year 1: 1.00, Year 2: 1.10, Year 3: 1.21 events/person-year
  Then (\mu_C = 1 + 1.1 + 1.21 = 3.31), giving
  [
  n \approx 107.15 \Rightarrow \boxed{108\ \text{per group}}
  ]

### Answer

* **About 103 per group** (smooth exponential increase model), or
* **About 108 per group** (stepwise-by-year increase model).

If you expect **dropout** or **overdispersion** (common in recurrent event counts), you’d usually inflate a bit (e.g., plan ~110–120 per group depending on how big you think that inflation factor is).
