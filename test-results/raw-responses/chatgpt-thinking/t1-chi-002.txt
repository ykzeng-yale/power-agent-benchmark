For a Pearson chi-square test of independence/homogeneity on a **3×2** table:

* Degrees of freedom: ((3-1)(2-1)=2)
* Cohen’s effect size: (w = 0.25)
* Noncentrality parameter: (\lambda = N w^2)
* Critical value at (\alpha=0.05): (\chi^2_{0.95,2} = 5.991)

Power is
[
\text{Power} = P\left(\chi^2_{df=2,;\lambda=Nw^2} > 5.991\right).
]

Solving this for **80% power** with (w=0.25) gives:
[
N \approx 154.16 ;\Rightarrow; \boxed{N = 155 \text{ total (round up)}}
]

So you need **about 155 participants total** (e.g., if evenly allocated across 3 groups: about **52 per group**, with one group having 51 to total 155).
