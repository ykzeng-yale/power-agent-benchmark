Assume this is a **cluster-randomized (or clinic-level) design** with **10 clinics per arm** (so inference is driven by clinics), equal cluster size (m), continuous outcome, standardized effect (d=0.3), ICC (\rho=0.05), two-sided (\alpha=0.05).

### 1) Variance / design effect at the clinic-mean level

For a cluster of size (m), the variance of a **cluster mean** is
[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar Y_{\text{cluster}})=\frac{\sigma^2{1+(m-1)\rho}}{m}.
]
The arm mean averages (K=10) cluster means, so
[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar Y_{\text{arm}})=\frac{\sigma^2{1+(m-1)\rho}}{mK}.
]
Difference in arm means (equal arms):
[
\mathrm{Var}(\Delta)=\frac{2\sigma^2{1+(m-1)\rho}}{mK}.
]

With (\delta = d\sigma), the **noncentrality parameter** for the usual cluster-level (t)-test is
[
\lambda
=\frac{\delta}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(\Delta)}}
= d\sqrt{\frac{mK}{2{1+(m-1)\rho}}}.
]
Degrees of freedom for the cluster-level two-sample test:
[
df = 2K-2 = 18.
]

### 2) Key insight: there’s a ceiling with fixed number of clinics

As (m\to\infty),
[
1+(m-1)\rho \approx m\rho
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\lambda \to d\sqrt{\frac{K}{2\rho}}.
]
Plugging in (d=0.3), (K=10), (\rho=0.05):
[
\lambda_{\max}=0.3\sqrt{\frac{10}{2(0.05)}}=0.3\sqrt{\frac{10}{0.1}}=0.3\cdot 10=3.
]
So even with *huge* (m), power can only creep up to around the level corresponding to (\lambda\approx 3) with (df=18).

### 3) Solve for (m) to get 80% power

Using the **two-sided noncentral t** power calculation with (df=18) and (\alpha=0.05), the smallest equal cluster size that reaches 80% power is:

[
\boxed{m \approx 750 \text{ patients per clinic}}
]

That implies totals:

* **Per arm:** (10 \times 750 = 7{,}500) patients
* **Overall:** (\approx 15{,}000) patients

### Practical takeaway

With **only 10 clinics per arm** and **ICC = 0.05**, increasing patients per clinic has sharply diminishing returns; power is fundamentally limited by the **number of clinics**. If you can increase the number of clinics per arm (even modestly), you can reduce the required patients/clinic dramatically.

If you tell me whether randomization is **by clinic** (cluster trial) or **within clinic** (individual randomization with clinic as a random effect/stratification), I can recompute—those designs have very different sample size needs.
