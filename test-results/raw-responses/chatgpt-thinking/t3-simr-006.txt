If the treatment effect on the **primary outcome** is a *constant shift* across the 4 visits (i.e., you’re powering a **main effect of treatment**, not a treatment×time interaction), then with a random‐intercept + residual model you can power it by thinking in terms of each subject’s **mean across timepoints**.

### 1) Map the mixed model to the variance of a subject’s mean

Model (primary outcome):
[
y_{ij} = \mu + \Delta\cdot \text{Trt}*i + b_i + \varepsilon*{ij},
\quad b_i\sim N(0,\sigma_b^2),\ \varepsilon_{ij}\sim N(0,\sigma_e^2)
]
Given:

* (\Delta = 0.4)
* (m=4) timepoints
* (\sigma_b = 0.5 \Rightarrow \sigma_b^2=0.25)
* (\sigma_e = 1.0 \Rightarrow \sigma_e^2=1)

Subject mean (\bar y_i) has variance:
[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar y_i)=\sigma_b^2+\frac{\sigma_e^2}{m}
=0.25+\frac{1}{4}=0.25+0.25=0.50
]

Then for a 1:1 two-arm comparison with (n) per group:
[
\mathrm{Var}(\hat\Delta)=\frac{2,\mathrm{Var}(\bar y_i)}{n}
=\frac{2(0.50)}{n}=\frac{1}{n}
]

### 2) Usual z-test approximation for 80% power, two-sided α=0.05

[
n=\frac{2(\sigma_b^2+\sigma_e^2/m),(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{\Delta^2}
]
With (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96), (z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.8}=0.842):
[
n=\frac{2(0.50),(1.96+0.842)^2}{0.4^2}
=\frac{1\times (2.802)^2}{0.16}
=\frac{7.85}{0.16}=49.1
]

### Result

**≈ 50 subjects per group** (≈ **100 total**) for **80% power** on the **primary outcome**.

### Note on the 2-outcome correlation (r = 0.6)

Because you’re powering the **treatment effect on the primary outcome**, the cross-outcome correlation usually **doesn’t materially reduce** the needed (n) unless you’re explicitly borrowing strength (e.g., strong structural constraints, missingness handled via joint modeling where the secondary informs the primary). For standard multivariate mixed models with complete data, the above is typically the right planning approximation.

If instead your treatment effect is defined as a **treatment×time interaction** (difference in slopes), the required (n) can change a lot—happy to compute that version too.
