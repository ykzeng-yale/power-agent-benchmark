We can convert the expected **odds ratio (OR = 0.6)** plus the **baseline risk in unexposed (p₀ = 0.25)** into the implied risk in exposed, then use a standard **two-sample proportions** power calculation (which is the usual approach for a binary exposure with known baseline risk).

## 1) Convert OR + baseline risk → risk in exposed

Unexposed odds:
[
\text{odds}_0=\frac{p_0}{1-p_0}=\frac{0.25}{0.75}=0.3333
]

Apply OR:
[
\text{odds}_1 = 0.6 \times 0.3333 = 0.2
]

Convert back to probability:
[
p_1=\frac{\text{odds}_1}{1+\text{odds}_1}=\frac{0.2}{1.2}=0.1667
]

So you’re powering for **25% vs 16.7%** (risk difference ≈ **0.0833**).

With exposure prevalence = 50%, you have **equal group sizes**.

## 2) Sample size for 90% power, two-sided α = 0.05

Using the common unpooled two-proportion approximation:
[
n_{\text{per group}}=
\frac{\left[z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{2\bar p(1-\bar p)}+z_{1-\beta}\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)+p_1(1-p_1)}\right]^2}{(p_1-p_0)^2}
]
where (\bar p=(p_0+p_1)/2).

Plugging in:

* (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.90}=1.2816)
* (p_0=0.25), (p_1=0.1667), (\bar p=0.2083)

This gives:

* **n ≈ 497.0 per group**, so round up to **498 per group**.

## Answer

* **Required sample size ≈ 498 exposed + 498 unexposed = 996 total participants** (assuming 50/50 exposure prevalence).

### Practical note

If you plan to use a more conservative method (e.g., continuity correction, adjustment for covariates, or some exposure imbalance/missingness), you’d typically inflate this modestly (often 5–15%).
