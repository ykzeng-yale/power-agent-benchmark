For two independent Poisson rates with equal follow-up time (t=1) year per subject and 1:1 allocation, a common large-sample (Wald) approximation uses

[
\frac{|\log(\text{RR})|}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{d_1}+\frac{1}{d_0}}};\ge; z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta},
]

where (d_0, d_1) are the **expected total numbers of events** in control and treatment.

**Given**

* Control rate: (\lambda_0 = 2) events/person-year
* Treatment rate: (\lambda_1 = 1.5\times 2 = 3) events/person-year
* Follow-up: (t=1) year
* Per-group sample size: (n)
* So (d_0 = n\lambda_0 t = 2n), (d_1 = n\lambda_1 t = 3n)

Then
[
\frac{1}{d_1}+\frac{1}{d_0}=\frac{1}{3n}+\frac{1}{2n}=\frac{5}{6n}.
]

Solve for (n):
[
n \ge \frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{(\log 1.5)^2}.
]

Plug in (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96) (two-sided (\alpha=0.05)) and (z_{1-\beta}=0.842) (80% power):

[
n \ge \frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{(1.96+0.842)^2}{(\log 1.5)^2}
\approx \frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{(2.802)^2}{(0.4055)^2}
\approx 39.8.
]

**Answer:** **(\boxed{40 \text{ subjects per group}})** (about **80 total**).

That corresponds to about **80 expected events** in control ((2\times 40)) and **120 expected events** in treatment ((3\times 40)) over 1 year.

*Note:* This assumes a true Poisson process (no overdispersion) and complete 1-year follow-up for everyone. If you expect overdispersion or dropout, you’d inflate (n) accordingly.
