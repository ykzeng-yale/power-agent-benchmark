We can approximate power by converting your **cluster RCT with unequal cluster sizes** into an **effective individual-level sample size** via an inflation (design effect) that accounts for ICC and the cluster-size CV.

## 1) Design effect with variable cluster sizes

A common approximation for unequal cluster sizes is:

[
DE ;=; 1 + ( \bar m - 1)\rho(1+CV^2)
]

* (\bar m = 20)
* (\rho = ICC = 0.03)
* (CV = 0.4 \Rightarrow (1+CV^2)=1+0.16=1.16)

[
DE = 1 + (20-1)(0.03)(1.16)
= 1 + 19 \cdot 0.03 \cdot 1.16
= 1 + 0.6612
= 1.6612
]

## 2) Effective sample size

Nominal per arm:
[
n_{\text{nom}} = 25 \times 20 = 500
]

Effective per arm:
[
n_{\text{eff}} = \frac{500}{1.6612} \approx 301.0
]

So this is roughly like an individually randomized trial with **~301 per arm**.

## 3) Power for two-sample comparison (standardized effect (d=0.3))

Using a normal approximation for a two-sided test at (\alpha=0.05):

[
\mu = d\sqrt{\frac{n_{\text{eff}}}{2}} = 0.3\sqrt{\frac{301.0}{2}} \approx 3.68
]
Critical value: (z_{0.975}=1.96)

Power:
[
\text{Power} = P(|Z|>1.96 \mid Z\sim N(\mu,1))
\approx 0.957
]

## Result

**Achieved power ≈ 95.7% (about 96%)** at **α = 0.05 (two-sided)**.

If you want, I can also compute the same power using a cluster-level t-test approximation (df based on number of clusters) to show how close it is—usually it’s very similar with 25 clusters/arm.
