We can do this with the usual **“individual-level sample size × design effect”** approximation.

### 1) Individual (non-clustered) two-sample proportion sample size

Control (p_C=0.30), Treatment (p_T=0.20), difference (\Delta = 0.10).
Two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96).
Power (=0.80 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=0.842).
(\bar p = (p_C+p_T)/2 = 0.25).

[
n_{\text{ind, per arm}}
=\frac{\left[z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{2\bar p(1-\bar p)};+; z_{1-\beta}\sqrt{p_C(1-p_C)+p_T(1-p_T)}\right]^2}{(p_C-p_T)^2}
]

Plugging in:

* (\sqrt{2\bar p(1-\bar p)}=\sqrt{2(0.25)(0.75)}=\sqrt{0.375}=0.612)
* (\sqrt{p_C(1-p_C)+p_T(1-p_T)}=\sqrt{0.30\cdot0.70+0.20\cdot0.80}=\sqrt{0.37}=0.608)

[
n_{\text{ind, per arm}}
=\frac{(1.96\cdot0.612 + 0.842\cdot0.608)^2}{0.10^2}
\approx \frac{(1.199+0.512)^2}{0.01}
\approx \frac{1.711^2}{0.01}
\approx 293.2
]

So, **about 294 per arm** if individuals were independent.

### 2) Inflate for clustering and solve for patients/clinic

ICC (\rho=0.02). If each clinic has (m) patients, the **design effect** is:
[
DE = 1 + (m-1)\rho
]

With **12 clinics per arm**, the “effective” independent sample size per arm is:
[
n_{\text{eff}} = \frac{12m}{DE}=\frac{12m}{1+(m-1)0.02}
]

Set (n_{\text{eff}} \approx 293.2) and solve:
[
\frac{12m}{1+0.02(m-1)} = 293.2
;\Rightarrow; m \approx 46.8
]

### ✅ Answer

**You need about 47 patients per clinic** (with 12 clinics per arm) for ~80% power at (\alpha=0.05) under this approximation.

* Per arm: (12 \times 47 = 564)
* Total: (24 \times 47 = 1128)

**Practical note:** with only **12 clusters/arm**, many teams round up a bit (e.g., **50 per clinic**) to hedge against small-sample/cluster-level degrees-of-freedom effects and any imbalance/missingness.
