A handy approximation is: if you expect the **treatment effect is the same at each of the 4 timepoints**, you can analyze the **subject-level average** (or equivalently a mixed model where the effect is constant over time). Then the repeated measures reduce the variance of each subject’s mean by the within-subject correlation (ICC).

### 1) Convert repeated measures into an “effective” effect size

Let:

* (m = 4) repeated measures
* ICC (within-subject correlation) ( \rho = 0.5 )
* cross-sectional standardized effect size (d = 0.5)

Variance of a subject’s mean under compound symmetry is:
[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar{Y}) = \sigma^2 \frac{1 + (m-1)\rho}{m}
]
So the SD of the mean is scaled by:
[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + (m-1)\rho}{m}}
]
That means the **effective** standardized effect size for comparing group means of subject-averages is:
[
d_{\text{eff}} = d \sqrt{\frac{m}{1 + (m-1)\rho}}
]

Plug in:
[
d_{\text{eff}} = 0.5 \sqrt{\frac{4}{1 + 3(0.5)}}
= 0.5 \sqrt{\frac{4}{2.5}}
= 0.5 \sqrt{1.6}
\approx 0.632
]

### 2) Two-sample size formula (two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power 0.80)

Using the normal approximation:
[
n_{\text{per group}} \approx \frac{2,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{d_{\text{eff}}^2}
]
with (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96), (z_{1-\beta}=0.84):

[
n \approx \frac{2(1.96+0.84)^2}{0.632^2}
= \frac{2(2.80)^2}{0.399}
\approx \frac{15.68}{0.399}
\approx 39.2
]

### Answer

**≈ 40 subjects per group** (so **~80 total**).

### Notes (when this changes)

* If your primary estimand is a **group × time interaction** (difference in slopes/trajectories), the needed (n) can be **quite different** (often larger), because you’re not just averaging repeated measures.
* Missing data/attrition: if you expect, say, 15% dropout, inflate to (40/0.85 \approx 48) per group.

If you tell me whether your key hypothesis is **overall mean difference** vs **difference in change over time**, I can tailor the calculation to that specific mixed-model contrast.
