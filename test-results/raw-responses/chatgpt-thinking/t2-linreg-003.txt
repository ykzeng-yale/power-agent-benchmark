To test whether the **3 added genetic markers** improve the model from **(R^2=0.20)** to **(R^2=0.30)**, you use the **partial (incremental) F-test** for adding a block of predictors.

### 1) Convert the targeted (R^2) increase into Cohen’s (f^2)

For adding predictors, the effect size is

[
f^2=\frac{R^2_{\text{full}}-R^2_{\text{reduced}}}{1-R^2_{\text{full}}}
]

[
f^2=\frac{0.30-0.20}{1-0.30}=\frac{0.10}{0.70}=0.142857
]

### 2) Degrees of freedom for the incremental F-test

* Number of added predictors: (q=3)  (numerator df)
* Full model predictors: (p_{\text{full}} = 4+3 = 7)
* Residual df: (v = N - p_{\text{full}} - 1 = N - 8)

### 3) Solve for (N) (80% power, (\alpha=0.05))

Using the noncentral F framework for the block test with (f^2=0.142857), (q=3), and (v=N-8), the smallest (N) that achieves **≥ 0.80 power** is:

[
\boxed{N = 85 \text{ total subjects}}
]

So you need **about 85 subjects** (total) to detect this incremental improvement under these assumptions.

**Practical note:** if you expect missingness/attrition, inflate: e.g., 10% loss ⇒ (85/0.90 \approx 95) subjects.

If you want, tell me whether you’ll test the added markers as a **single block** (as assumed here) or do any penalization/selection (which changes the effective test and typically needs more (N)).
