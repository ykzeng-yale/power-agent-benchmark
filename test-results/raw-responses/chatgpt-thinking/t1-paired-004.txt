For a standard **2×2 bioequivalence crossover** analyzed as a **paired t-test on within-subject differences**, using a standardized effect size

[
d=\frac{\Delta}{\sigma_w}=0.25
]

the approximate required number of subjects is

[
n \approx \left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{d}\right)^2
]

With **95% power** ((\beta=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.95}=1.645)) and **two-sided (\alpha=0.01)** ((z_{1-\alpha/2}=z_{0.995}=2.576)):

[
n \approx \left(\frac{2.576+1.645}{0.25}\right)^2
= \left(\frac{4.221}{0.25}\right)^2
= (16.884)^2
\approx 285.1
]

✅ **Round up: (\boxed{286}) subjects total** (each subject receives both treatments).

**If you instead meant one-sided (\alpha=0.01)** (sometimes used when you truly only care about detecting a difference in one direction):

* (z_{1-\alpha}=z_{0.99}=2.326)

[
n \approx \left(\frac{2.326+1.645}{0.25}\right)^2 \approx 252.3 \Rightarrow \boxed{253}
]

Practical note: if you expect dropout, inflate e.g. **10% dropout →** (286/0.9 \approx 318) subjects to enroll.
