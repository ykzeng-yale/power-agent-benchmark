In a 3-treatment Latin square crossover where **each subject receives A and control once**, the **A vs control** effect is essentially powered by a **within-subject (paired) comparison**.

### 1) Variance of the within-subject contrast

If the outcome has marginal SD ( \sigma ) and the **period-to-period correlation** is ( \rho ), then for a subject’s difference
[
D_i = Y_{iA} - Y_{iC},
]
[
\mathrm{Var}(D_i)=\mathrm{Var}(Y_{iA})+\mathrm{Var}(Y_{iC})-2\mathrm{Cov}(Y_{iA},Y_{iC})
= 2\sigma^2(1-\rho).
]
So the SD of the paired difference is
[
\sigma_D = \sigma\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}.
]

### 2) Required (n) for a two-sided test

With standardized effect size (d = \delta/\sigma) (where (\delta) is the mean difference A–control), the paired-test sample size is
[
n ;=; \left(\frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta});\sigma_D}{\delta}\right)^2
;=; \left(\frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta});\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}}{d}\right)^2.
]

Plug in:

* (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* power (=0.80 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=0.84)
* (\rho=0.6 \Rightarrow 2(1-\rho)=0.8)
* (d=0.4)

[
n=\left(\frac{(1.96+0.84)\sqrt{0.8}}{0.4}\right)^2
=\left(\frac{2.80\times 0.8944}{0.4}\right)^2
=\left(6.26\right)^2
\approx 39.2.
]

### Answer

* **About 40 subjects** total.

**Design rounding:** A 3-treatment Latin square is typically run with subjects allocated evenly across **3 sequences**, so round up to a multiple of 3:

* **42 subjects** (14 per sequence) is the clean, practical choice.

If you also need to inflate for dropout/noncompliance, multiply 42 by (1/(1-\text{dropout})) and round up to the next multiple of 3.
