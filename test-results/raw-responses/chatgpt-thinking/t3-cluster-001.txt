For a **parallel, cluster-randomized trial** with a **continuous outcome** and equal cluster sizes, a quick (standard) way to size **patients per clinic** is:

### 1) Individual-level sample size (ignoring clustering)

With standardized effect (d=0.4), two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (=0.80):

[
n_{\text{indiv, per arm}}
= \frac{2,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{d^2}
= \frac{2,(1.96+0.84)^2}{0.4^2}
\approx \frac{2\cdot 2.8^2}{0.16}
\approx 98
]

So you need about **98 “effective” independent patients per arm**.

### 2) Convert to cluster design using the design effect

With ICC (\rho=0.05) and (m) patients/clinic:

[
\text{Design Effect} = 1 + (m-1)\rho = 1 + (m-1)\cdot 0.05
]

Effective sample size per arm with (k=20) clinics/arm:

[
n_{\text{eff, per arm}} = \frac{k,m}{1+(m-1)\rho}
= \frac{20m}{1+0.05(m-1)}
= \frac{20m}{0.95+0.05m}
]

Set this (\ge 98) and solve:

[
\frac{20m}{0.95+0.05m} \ge 98
\Rightarrow 20m \ge 98(0.95+0.05m)
\Rightarrow 15.1m \ge 93.1
\Rightarrow m \ge 6.17
]

### Result

You need **7 patients per clinic** (rounding up).

* **Per arm:** (20 \times 7 = 140) patients
* **Total (2 arms):** (280) patients

**Answer: ~7 patients per clinic** to achieve ~80% power at (\alpha=0.05) (two-sided), given 20 clinics/arm and ICC = 0.05.

If you expect uneven clinic sizes or patient-level dropout, you’ll want to inflate (m) a bit (often +10–20% depending on what you anticipate).
