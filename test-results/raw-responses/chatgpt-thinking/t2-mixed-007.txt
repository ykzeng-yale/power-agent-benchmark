For a standard 2×2 (AB/BA) crossover with a continuous outcome, the treatment effect is typically tested using the **within-subject treatment difference**, i.e., a **paired t-test** on each subject’s (A − B) (or equivalently B − A).

### 1) Convert your “total-SD” effect size into the paired-difference effect size

Let the marginal (total) SD be (\sigma). You told me the treatment effect is

[
\Delta = d,\sigma,\quad d=0.6
]

If the within-subject correlation between the two period measurements is (\rho=0.7), then the SD of the within-subject difference is

[
\sigma_D=\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(Y_A-Y_B)}=\sqrt{2\sigma^2(1-\rho)}=\sigma\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}.
]

So the standardized effect size **on the paired-difference scale** is

[
d_{\text{paired}}=\frac{\Delta}{\sigma_D}
=\frac{d,\sigma}{\sigma\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}}
=\frac{d}{\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}}
=\frac{0.6}{\sqrt{2(0.3)}}\approx 0.7746.
]

### 2) Sample size for 85% power at (\alpha=0.05) (two-sided)

Using the exact **noncentral t** power calculation for a paired t-test (df (=n-1)):

* (n=16) gives power (\approx 0.825)
* **(n=17) gives power (\approx 0.850)**

✅ **Minimum total subjects needed: 17**

### 3) Practical crossover detail: balance the two sequences

In AB/BA you usually want equal numbers in each sequence, so you’d round up to an even total:

✅ **Recommended: 18 subjects total (9 AB, 9 BA)**

If you tell me whether you’re using **one-sided vs two-sided**, and whether you want to account for **dropout**, I can adjust the final number accordingly.
