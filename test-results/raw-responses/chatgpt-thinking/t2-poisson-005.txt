Assume a **zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP)** model with a **structural-zero probability** (\pi=0.30) that’s the same in both arms, and among “susceptible” patients ((1-\pi=0.70)) the counts are Poisson with means (\lambda_C=3) (control) and (\lambda_T=2) (treatment).

### 1) Mean and variance under ZIP

Let (Y=0) with prob (\pi), otherwise (Y\sim \text{Pois}(\lambda)).

* Mean:
  [
  \mu = \mathbb{E}[Y]=(1-\pi)\lambda
  ]
* Variance:
  [
  \mathrm{Var}(Y)=(1-\pi)\lambda\bigl(1+\pi\lambda\bigr)
  ]

Compute for each arm:

**Control**
[
\mu_C = 0.7\cdot 3 = 2.1
]
[
\mathrm{Var}_C = 0.7\cdot 3 \cdot (1+0.3\cdot 3)=2.1(1+0.9)=2.1\cdot 1.9=3.99
]

**Treatment**
[
\mu_T = 0.7\cdot 2 = 1.4
]
[
\mathrm{Var}_T = 0.7\cdot 2 \cdot (1+0.3\cdot 2)=1.4(1+0.6)=1.4\cdot 1.6=2.24
]

Difference in overall means:
[
\Delta = \mu_C-\mu_T = 2.1-1.4 = 0.7
]

### 2) Two-sample normal approximation for difference in means

With equal group sizes (n), independent groups:
[
SE(\hat\Delta)=\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{Var}_C}{n}+\frac{\mathrm{Var}_T}{n}}
= \sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{Var}_C+\mathrm{Var}_T}{n}}
]

Required (n) for two-sided (\alpha=0.05) and power (1-\beta=0.80):
[
n=\frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2(\mathrm{Var}*C+\mathrm{Var}*T)}{\Delta^2}
]
Use (z*{1-\alpha/2}=1.96), (z*{1-\beta}=0.84).

[
\mathrm{Var}*C+\mathrm{Var}*T = 3.99+2.24 = 6.23
]
[
(z*{1-\alpha/2}+z*{1-\beta})^2=(1.96+0.84)^2=(2.80)^2=7.84
]
[
n=\frac{7.84\cdot 6.23}{0.7^2}
=\frac{48.84}{0.49}\approx 99.7
]

### Result

**≈ 100 patients per group** (so **≈ 200 total**) for 80% power at (\alpha=0.05) under these ZIP assumptions.

**Notes (what this hinges on):**

* structural-zero proportion truly ~30% and **same in both arms**
* Poisson among susceptibles (no extra overdispersion beyond the zero inflation)
* equal follow-up/exposure time per patient (or counts already standardized)

If you expect additional overdispersion (common in count data), you’d need more than 100/arm.
