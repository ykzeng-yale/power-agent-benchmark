For a chi-square **goodness-of-fit** test with **5 categories**, the degrees of freedom are:

* (df = k-1 = 5-1 = 4)

Cohen’s effect size (w) relates to the **noncentrality parameter** by:

* (\lambda = N w^2)

Power is computed as:

* (\text{Power} = P\left(\chi^2_{df=4,\ \lambda} > \chi^2_{df=4,\ 1-\alpha}\right))

With (\alpha = 0.05):

* Critical value: (\chi^2_{4,,0.95} = 9.4877)

Solve for (N) such that power (=0.85) when (w=0.35). Numerically, this gives:

* (N \approx 109.57)  (\Rightarrow) **round up to (N = 110)**

✅ **Required total sample size: ~110 observations** (across all 5 categories).
