Assuming a **random‐intercept–only** mixed model (so the within‐subject correlation is compound symmetry) and a **two-sided** test with **α = 0.05**, you can approximate the power for the treatment effect using the variance of each subject’s **mean outcome** across the 5 measurements.

### 1) Convert the mixed model SDs to the variance of a subject mean

* Random intercept SD (=0.8 \Rightarrow \sigma_b^2 = 0.8^2 = 0.64)
* Residual SD (=1.0 \Rightarrow \sigma_e^2 = 1.0^2 = 1.00)
* Measurements per subject: (m=5)

Variance of a subject’s average (under random intercept + residual):
[
\mathrm{Var}(\bar Y) = \sigma_b^2 + \frac{\sigma_e^2}{m}
= 0.64 + \frac{1.00}{5}
= 0.64 + 0.20
= 0.84
]

### 2) Standard error for the treatment difference (1:1 groups, (n) per group)

[
\mathrm{SE}(\hat\delta)=\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot \mathrm{Var}(\bar Y)}{n}}
=\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 0.84}{n}}
]

### 3) Solve for (n) for 80% power

With (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96) and (z_{1-\beta}=0.84) (80% power), detectable difference (\delta=0.5):
[
n
=

# \frac{2(\sigma_b^2+\sigma_e^2/m),(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{\delta^2}

\frac{2(0.84),(1.96+0.84)^2}{0.5^2}
\approx 52.7
]

### Result

**You need about (\boxed{53}) subjects per group** (round up; many would plan **54 per group**).

**Notes (why this is reasonable):**

* This is the usual closed-form approximation for a random-intercept LMM with equal measurement times and complete data.
* If you expect dropout/missing visits, inflate (n) (or use simulation) since losing measurements reduces the effective (m).
