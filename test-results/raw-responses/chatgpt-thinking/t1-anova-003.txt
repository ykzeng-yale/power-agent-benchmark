For a **one-way ANOVA** comparing **k = 5** groups with **Cohen’s f = 0.20**, **α = 0.05**, and **90% power**, assuming **equal group sizes**, you need:

* **n ≈ 78 participants per group**
* **Total N ≈ 390**

How this is obtained (in brief): for a balanced one-way ANOVA, the test uses an **F** distribution with

* ( df_1 = k-1 = 4 )
* ( df_2 = N-k )
  and noncentrality parameter ( \lambda = f^2 , N ). We pick the smallest (N) (multiple of 5) such that
  [
  \text{Power} = P!\left(F_{4,,N-5,;\lambda} > F_{1-\alpha;,4,,N-5}\right) \ge 0.90.
  ]
  That threshold is first reached at **N = 390** → **78/group**.

If you expect dropout, inflate: e.g., **10% attrition ⇒ 78 / 0.9 ≈ 87 per group** (total ≈ 435).
