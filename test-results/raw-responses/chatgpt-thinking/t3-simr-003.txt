Using the standard random‐intercept / random‐slope LMM

[
y_{ij}=\beta_0+\beta_1 t_{j}+\beta_2 g_i+\beta_3(g_i t_{j})+b_{0i}+b_{1i} t_{j}+\varepsilon_{ij},
]

with (t_j=0,1,2,3,4,5), (g_i\in{0,1}), (b_{0i}\sim N(0,\sigma_{b0}^2)), (b_{1i}\sim N(0,\sigma_{b1}^2)), (\varepsilon_{ij}\sim N(0,\sigma_e^2)), and **assuming** (\text{Cov}(b_{0i},b_{1i})=0) (since it wasn’t provided):

* (\sigma_{b0}=1.0 \Rightarrow \sigma_{b0}^2=1.00)
* (\sigma_{b1}=0.2 \Rightarrow \sigma_{b1}^2=0.04)
* (\sigma_e=1.0 \Rightarrow \sigma_e^2=1.00)
* (n=40) per group, 2 groups (\Rightarrow N=80)
* True slope difference (the interaction) (\beta_3=0.1)

### 1) Compute the SE of the group×time slope difference

Within a subject, the covariance is

[
V=\sigma_{b0}^2 \mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}^\top + \sigma_{b1}^2 , tt^\top + \sigma_e^2 I.
]

With balanced groups, the fixed-effect information is
[
X^\top V^{-1} X \text{ summed over all subjects,}
]
and the variance of (\hat\beta_3) is the ((4,4)) element of ((X^\top V^{-1}X)^{-1}).

Plugging your numbers in gives:

[
SE(\hat\beta_3)\approx 0.0697.
]

So the standardized effect for the Wald test is
[
\frac{\beta_3}{SE}\approx \frac{0.1}{0.0697}\approx 1.435.
]

### 2) Power at (\alpha=0.05) (two-sided)

Using a Wald (z)-test approximation:

[
\text{Power} = P(|Z|>1.96 \mid Z\sim N(1.435,1)) \approx 0.30.
]

If you instead use a (t)-approximation with ~76 df (roughly (80-4)), it’s essentially the same:

[
\text{Power} \approx 0.294.
]

## Result

**With 40 subjects per group, you achieve ~29–30% power** to detect a slope difference of **0.1 per time unit** at **α = 0.05** (two-sided), under the assumptions above.

If you tell me the random intercept–slope correlation (often negative) and whether you plan REML + Kenward–Roger/Satterthwaite df, I can refine the power slightly—but it won’t jump from 30% to anywhere near 80% with these effect/variance numbers.
