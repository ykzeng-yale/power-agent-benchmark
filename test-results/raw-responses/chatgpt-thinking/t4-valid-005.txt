Using the same setup as before (binary DVT outcome; anticipated **C = 0.82**, **prevalence = 0.22**, and LP approximately **Normal(mean = −1.75, SD = 2.16)**), and your *relaxed* precision targets:

* **AUC (C-statistic) 95% CI width ≤ 0.10**
* **Calibration slope 95% CI width ≤ 0.30**
* **O/E 95% CI width ≤ 0.30**

the required validation sample size is the **maximum** of the three separate “precision-driven” requirements.

---

## 1) C-statistic CI width ≤ 0.10  →  **N ≈ 510**

Use a standard large-sample AUC SE approximation (Hanley–McNeil style) with

* (n_1 = 0.22N) events, (n_0 = 0.78N) non-events,
* want half-width (=0.05), so (1.96\cdot SE \le 0.05\Rightarrow SE\le 0.02551).

Solving gives **N ≈ 510** total.

---

## 2) O/E CI width ≤ 0.30  →  **events ≈ 173 ⇒ N ≈ 787**

A common planning approximation is to treat (\log(O/E)) as approximately Normal with
(\mathrm{Var}[\log(O/E)] \approx 1/O) (Poisson-type argument for observed events (O)).

Then 95% CI on the ratio scale is roughly:
[
\left[\exp!\left(-\frac{1.96}{\sqrt{O}}\right),\ \exp!\left(\frac{1.96}{\sqrt{O}}\right)\right]
]
so width (\approx \exp(h)-\exp(-h)) where (h=1.96/\sqrt{O}).

Requiring width ≤ 0.30 gives **O ≈ 173 events**. With prevalence 0.22:
[
N \ge \frac{173}{0.22} \approx 786.4 \Rightarrow \boxed{N \approx 787}
]

---

## 3) Calibration slope CI width ≤ 0.30  →  **N ≈ 884 (this is binding)**

For the calibration slope, we plan via the **expected Fisher information** from a logistic recalibration model:
[
\text{logit}(Y)=a + b\cdot LP
]
with both (a) and (b) estimated.

Because you gave both **LP distribution** and **prevalence**, the coherent way to use both is:

* treat the provided LP as the *predictor part*,
* allow an intercept shift (\alpha) so that predicted risks match the prevalence on average:
  [
  p = \text{expit}(\alpha + LP),\quad \mathbb{E}[p]=0.22
  ]
  (That (\alpha) is just the “calibration-in-the-large” needed so that average risk matches 0.22.)

Then with (w=p(1-p)), the large-sample variance of (b) (with an intercept in the model) is:
[
\mathrm{Var}(b)\approx \frac{\mathbb{E}[w]}{N\left(\mathbb{E}[w]\mathbb{E}[wLP^2]-(\mathbb{E}[wLP])^2\right)}
]
and we require width ≤ 0.30 ⇒ half-width 0.15:
[
1.96\cdot SE(b)\le 0.15
]

Carrying this through under (LP\sim N(-1.75,,2.16^2)) and (\mathbb{E}[p]=0.22) gives:
[
\boxed{N \approx 884}
]

---

# Reduced required sample size

Take the maximum requirement:

* AUC: ~510
* O/E: ~787
* **Slope: ~884 (largest)**

✅ **Reduced validation sample size: (\boxed{N \approx 884})** total
That corresponds to about **(0.22\times 884 \approx 195)** events and **689** non-events.

If you want, I can also give the *achieved* CI widths at N = 884 for each metric (so you can document it in a protocol).
