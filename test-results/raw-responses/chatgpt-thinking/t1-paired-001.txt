For a **pre–post (paired) design**, you typically analyze the **within-person change** (post − pre) with a **one-sample t-test on the change scores**.

### Inputs

* Mean improvement (effect to detect): (\Delta = 5)
* SD of changes: (\sigma_d = 10)
* Standardized effect: (d = \Delta/\sigma_d = 5/10 = 0.5)
* Power: (1-\beta = 0.80 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta} = 0.84)
* Significance: (\alpha = 0.05) (assuming **two-sided**) (\Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2} = 1.96)

### Sample size (normal approximation)

[
n ;=;\left(\frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})\sigma_d}{\Delta}\right)^2
;=;\left(\frac{(1.96+0.84)\cdot 10}{5}\right)^2
]
[
=\left(\frac{2.80\cdot 10}{5}\right)^2
=\left(5.6\right)^2
=31.36
]

### Result

You need **(n = 32)** patients (round up).

**Practical note:** If you expect dropout/missing follow-up, inflate: e.g., 15% attrition ⇒ (32/0.85 \approx 38) patients to enroll.
