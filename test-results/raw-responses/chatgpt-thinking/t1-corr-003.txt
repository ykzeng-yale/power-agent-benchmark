To power a test of correlation (typically **H₀: ρ = 0** vs **H₁: ρ ≠ 0**) using the **Fisher z-transform**, a common approximation is:

* Fisher transform:
  [
  z = \operatorname{atanh}(r)=\tfrac12\ln\Big(\frac{1+r}{1-r}\Big)
  ]
* Standard error under H₀:
  [
  SE(z) \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{n-3}}
  ]
* Required sample size (two-sided α, power (1-\beta)):
  [
  n \approx 3 + \left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{\operatorname{atanh}(r)}\right)^2
  ]

### Plug in your numbers

* Expected correlation: (r = 0.15)
* (\alpha = 0.05) (two-sided) → (z_{1-\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} = 1.96)
* Power = 0.80 → (z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.80} = 0.842)
* (\operatorname{atanh}(0.15) \approx 0.15114)

Compute:
[
n \approx 3 + \left(\frac{1.96 + 0.842}{0.15114}\right)^2
= 3 + (18.54)^2
= 3 + 343.59
= 346.59
]

### Result

You need **347 patients** (round up) for **80% power** at **α = 0.05 (two-sided)** to detect a true correlation of **r = 0.15**.

Practical note: if you expect missing outcomes/biomarker values, inflate (n) (e.g., 10% missing → (347/0.90 \approx 386)).
