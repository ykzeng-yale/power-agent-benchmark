Using the **log-rank test / Cox PH** approximation:

## 1) Required number of events

For equal allocation (1:1), the required total number of events is

[
D ;=; \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{(\ln HR)^2 ; p(1-p)}
]

* (\alpha=0.05) (two-sided) (\Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* Power (=80%) (\Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=0.84)
* (HR=0.70 \Rightarrow \ln(HR)=\ln(0.70)=-0.3567)
* (p=0.5 \Rightarrow p(1-p)=0.25)

[
D=\frac{(1.96+0.84)^2}{(0.3567)^2\cdot 0.25}
= \frac{(2.80)^2}{0.1272\cdot 0.25}
\approx \frac{7.84}{0.0318}
\approx 247
]

**Events needed: ~247 total events.**

## 2) Convert events → total sample size (given study duration 36 months)

Assume **exponential survival** and **uniform accrual over the full 36 months**, with analysis at month 36 (so the last patient can have ~0 follow-up).

Control median = 18 months
[
\lambda_C=\frac{\ln 2}{18}=0.0385 \text{ per month}
]
Treatment hazard (\lambda_T = 0.70\lambda_C = 0.0270).

With uniform accrual over (T=36), the **average** event probability for a subject in a group is:
[
\bar{P}(\text{event}) = 1 - \frac{1}{T}\cdot\frac{1-e^{-\lambda T}}{\lambda}
]

This gives approximately:

* Control: (\bar{P}_C \approx 0.459)
* Treatment: (\bar{P}_T \approx 0.360)

Overall event fraction (1:1 allocation):
[
\bar{P}_{overall} \approx \frac{0.459+0.360}{2}=0.409
]

So total sample size:
[
N = \frac{D}{\bar{P}_{overall}} \approx \frac{247}{0.409} \approx 603
]

## ✅ Answer

**Total sample size ≈ 603 participants (about 302 per arm)**, under the standard assumptions above (exponential survival, proportional hazards, uniform accrual over 36 months, no loss to follow-up).

### Quick sensitivity (if accrual is shorter than 36 months)

If instead you accrue for **24 months** and still analyze at **36 months** (so everyone has ≥12 months follow-up), the needed total drops to about **~467** participants.
