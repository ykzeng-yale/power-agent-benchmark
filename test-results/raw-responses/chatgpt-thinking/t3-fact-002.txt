To power the **2×2 interaction** (difference-in-differences) with **equal n per cell**, you can treat the interaction contrast as:

[
C = (\mu_{11}-\mu_{10})-(\mu_{01}-\mu_{00})
]

If the within-cell SD is (\sigma) and you define the standardized interaction effect as

[
d_{\text{int}}=\frac{C}{\sigma}=0.3,
]

then with (n) per cell, the variance of the estimated contrast is:

[
\mathrm{Var}(\hat C)=\sigma^2\left(\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}\right)=\frac{4\sigma^2}{n},
\quad
SE(\hat C)=\frac{2\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.
]

So the “z-style” noncentrality for the interaction test is:

[
\frac{C}{SE}=\frac{d_{\text{int}}\sigma}{2\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{d_{\text{int}}\sqrt{n}}{2}.
]

For **two-sided (\alpha=0.05)** and **80% power**, use (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96) and (z_{0.80}=0.84):

[
\frac{d_{\text{int}}\sqrt{n}}{2}=1.96+0.84=2.80
]

[
\sqrt{n}=\frac{2(2.80)}{0.3}=\frac{5.6}{0.3}=18.67
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
n=348.4
]

**Answer:** (\boxed{n \approx 349 \text{ per cell}}) (rounded up)

* Total (N = 4n \approx 1396).

Notes/assumptions: balanced design, continuous outcome, common within-cell SD, interaction effect (d=0.3) interpreted as the standardized **difference-in-differences**; this is a large-(n) approximation (the exact t/F-based calculation will be extremely close at this (N)).
