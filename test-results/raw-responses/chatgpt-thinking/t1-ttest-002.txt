For a **two-sample comparison of means** (equal group sizes, common SD), a standard approximation is:

[
n_{\text{per group}}
====================

\frac{2\sigma^2\left(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}\right)^2}{\Delta^2}
]

Given:

* Expected mean difference (treatment − control) (\Delta = 15) mg/dL
* Common SD (\sigma = 30) mg/dL
* Two-sided (\alpha = 0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=z_{0.975}=1.96)
* Power (=90% \Rightarrow \beta=0.10 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.90}=1.2816)

Plug in:

[
n = \frac{2(30^2)(1.96+1.2816)^2}{15^2}
= \frac{2(900)(3.2416)^2}{225}
\approx \frac{1800 \cdot 10.512}{225}
\approx 84.06
]

So you need **85 participants per group** (round up from 84.06) for 90% power at two-sided 0.05.

*(This is the usual normal-approximation planning formula; exact t-based calculations typically land extremely close at these sample sizes.)*
