Because you have **replication (3 per run)**, you can test each main effect with a usual **two-sample (± level) t-test / regression t-test** using the pure error from replication.

### 1) Effective sample size for a main effect

Total observations:

* 8 runs × 3 replicates = **N = 24**

For any main effect in a balanced 2-level design:

* # at “+” level = **12**
* # at “−” level = **12**

The main-effect estimator is the difference in means:
[
\hat{E}=\bar{Y}*{+}-\bar{Y}*{-}
]
with
[
\text{SE}(\hat{E})=\sigma\sqrt{\frac{1}{12}+\frac{1}{12}}
= \sigma\sqrt{\frac{1}{6}}
]

### 2) Noncentrality for the t test

You gave standardized true main effect (\delta = 1.5) (in (\sigma) units), i.e. true difference (E = 1.5\sigma). Then
[
\text{ncp}=\frac{E}{\text{SE}}=\frac{1.5\sigma}{\sigma\sqrt{1/6}}
=1.5\sqrt{6}=3.674
]

### 3) Degrees of freedom

If you analyze main effects with the usual model (intercept + 4 main effects), the error df comes from replication:
[
df = N - (1+4) = 24-5 = 19
]

### 4) Power at (\alpha=0.05) (two-sided)

Critical value: (t_{0.975,19} \approx 2.093).
Power (= P(|T|>2.093)) for a noncentral t with (df=19), ncp (=3.674):

[
\boxed{\text{Power} \approx 0.936 \ \text{(93.6%)}}
]

**Answer:** About **94% power** to detect a standardized main effect of **1.5σ** at **α = 0.05** (two-sided), with this 8-run Res IV fraction and 3 replicates/run.

*(If you meant a one-sided α=0.05 test, power would be about **97.1%**.)*
