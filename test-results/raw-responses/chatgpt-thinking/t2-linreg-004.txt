Assuming you’re powering the **overall multiple linear regression F-test** (i.e., testing (H_0: R^2=0)) with **10 predictors**, using Cohen’s (f^2=0.15), **power = 0.85**, and **(\alpha=0.01)**:

### Step 1) Convert (f^2) to (R^2) (optional intuition)

[
f^2=\frac{R^2}{1-R^2}\quad\Rightarrow\quad R^2=\frac{f^2}{1+f^2}=\frac{0.15}{1.15}\approx 0.1304
]

### Step 2) Power calculation (noncentral F)

For the overall model test:

* Numerator df: (u = 10)
* Denominator df: (v = N - u - 1 = N - 11)
* Critical value: (F_{1-\alpha;u,v})
* Noncentrality (as used in standard power tools, e.g., G*Power for “(R^2) deviation from zero”):
  [
  \lambda = f^2 \cdot N
  ]
  Power is:
  [
  \Pr\left(F_{u,v,\lambda} > F_{1-\alpha;u,v}\right)
  ]

Solving for the smallest (N) with power (\ge 0.85) gives:

## ✅ Required sample size: **(N = 174)** total observations

That corresponds to denominator df (v = 174-11 = 163), and achieved power (\approx 0.852).

---

If instead you meant detecting the **incremental effect of a subset** (e.g., 1 predictor added last, or a block of predictors), the needed (N) can change (because (u) would be the number tested, and the denominator df depends on the **total** predictors in the full model).
