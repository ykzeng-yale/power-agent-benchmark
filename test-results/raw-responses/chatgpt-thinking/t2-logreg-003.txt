We can treat this as a power problem for testing the **biomarker slope** in a multivariable logistic regression, using the common Hsieh-style normal-covariate approximation (biomarker ~ Normal, Wald test of ( \beta=0 )) and adjusting for correlation with other covariates via the **partial variance** (1-R^2).

### 1) Inputs

* Baseline readmission prevalence (overall): ( \pi = 0.15 )
* Biomarker is standardized (per SD increase): (X \sim N(0,1))
* Target odds ratio per SD: ( \text{OR} = 1.8 \Rightarrow \beta = \log(1.8)=0.5878 )
* Confounders explain (R^2=0.10) of the biomarker variance
  (\Rightarrow \mathrm{Var}(X \mid \text{others}) = 1-R^2 = 0.9)
* (\alpha=0.05) (two-sided) (\Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* Power (=0.80) (\Rightarrow z_{0.80}=0.842)

### 2) Fisher information for the biomarker slope

For logistic regression with linear predictor
[
\eta = a + \beta X,\quad p(X)=\text{logit}^{-1}(\eta),
]
the per-subject Fisher information for (\beta) is
[
I_{\beta\beta} = \mathbb{E}\big[p(X)(1-p(X)),X^2\big],
]
with (X \sim N(0,;0.9)) (because of the (R^2) adjustment).

We choose the intercept (a) so that the **marginal** event rate is 0.15:
[
\mathbb{E}[p(X)] = 0.15.
]
With (\beta=\log(1.8)) and (\mathrm{Var}(X)=0.9), this gives (a \approx -1.839), and then
[
I_{\beta\beta} \approx 0.116.
]

### 3) Solve for (n)

Using the Wald-test planning approximation:
[
\frac{|\beta|}{\mathrm{SE}(\hat\beta)} \approx |\beta|\sqrt{n,I_{\beta\beta}}
]
and requiring this to exceed (z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{\text{power}}), we get
[
n ;=; \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{\text{power}})^2}{\beta^2,I_{\beta\beta}}
;=;
\frac{(1.96+0.842)^2}{(0.5878)^2,(0.116)}
;\approx; 196.
]

## Answer

**About 200 patients total** (≈ **196**) to have **80% power** at **α = 0.05 (two-sided)** to detect an **OR = 1.8 per SD** for the biomarker, given **baseline readmission 15%** and **(R^2=0.10)** with other covariates.

### Quick reality check (events)

At 15% prevalence, (196\times 0.15 \approx 29) readmissions (events).

That’s often **thin** for *developing* a multivariable model with 5 covariates (rules-of-thumb like EPV≥10 would want ≈50 events → ≈333 patients; EPV≥20 would want ≈100 events → ≈667 patients). But **for power to detect the biomarker effect**, the ≈200 total estimate is the direct answer.

If you tell me whether α is **one-sided vs two-sided**, and whether the **15%** is truly *overall* prevalence (vs “at mean biomarker”), I can tweak the number (it moves a bit, but not dramatically).
