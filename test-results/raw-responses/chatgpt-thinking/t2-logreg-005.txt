Assume “5% baseline risk” means the **unexposed** outcome risk (p_0=0.05), and exposure prevalence is 30% (so (n_1:n_0 = 0.30:0.70)).

## 1) Convert OR to risk in exposed

[
\text{odds}_0=\frac{p_0}{1-p_0}=\frac{0.05}{0.95}=0.05263
]
[
\text{odds}_1 = OR\cdot \text{odds}_0 = 2.5\times 0.05263 = 0.13158
]
[
p_1=\frac{\text{odds}_1}{1+\text{odds}_1}=\frac{0.13158}{1.13158}=0.11628
]

So we’re comparing (p_0=0.050) vs (p_1\approx 0.116).

## 2) Two-sample proportions power (unequal group sizes)

Let (r=n_1/n_0 = 0.30/0.70 = 0.4286). With two-sided (\alpha=0.05), (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96); for 80% power, (z_{1-\beta}=0.842).

Using the standard normal-approximation sample size for a difference in proportions with fixed ratio (r):
[
n_0=\frac{\left[z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{\bar p(1-\bar p)\left(\frac{1+r}{r}\right)} + z_{1-\beta}\sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{r}+p_0(1-p_0)}\right]^2}{(p_1-p_0)^2}
]
where
[
\bar p=\frac{p_1 r + p_0}{1+r}.
]

Plugging in values gives:

* (n_0 \approx 424) unexposed
* (n_1 = r n_0 \approx 182) exposed
* **Total (N \approx 606)**

### ✅ Answer (primary interpretation)

**You need about *606 total participants*** (≈ **182 exposed** and **424 unexposed**) for 80% power at (\alpha=0.05) (two-sided).

---

### If “5% baseline risk” meant the **overall** outcome prevalence (not unexposed)

Then the implied risks are lower in each group (approximately (p_0\approx 0.0354), (p_1\approx 0.0841)), and the required total rises to about **826**.

If you tell me whether the 5% refers to **unexposed** vs **overall**, I’ll lock in the single final number.
