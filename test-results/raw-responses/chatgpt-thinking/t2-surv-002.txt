Assuming **exponential survival**, **proportional hazards**, **1:1 randomization**, **uniform accrual over 2 years**, **+1 year additional follow-up** (so study ends at 3 years), and **no loss to follow-up**, you can do this in two steps: (1) required **number of events** for a log-rank test, then (2) convert events → **sample size** using the expected event proportion by study end.

## 1) Events required (log-rank)

For equal allocation, the required total number of events is

[
D ;=; \frac{4,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{(\ln HR)^2}.
]

* Two-sided (\alpha=0.05 \Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=z_{0.975}=1.96)
* Power (=0.80 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.80}=0.842)
* (HR=0.65 \Rightarrow \ln(HR)=\ln(0.65)=-0.4308)

[
D \approx \frac{4(1.96+0.842)^2}{0.4308^2}
\approx \frac{4(2.802)^2}{0.1856}
\approx 169.2 \text{ events.}
]

So you need about **169 total events**.

## 2) Expected event proportion by study end (with staggered entry)

Control has **50% 2-year survival**, so under exponential survival:

[
S_c(2)=0.5=e^{-\lambda_c\cdot 2};\Rightarrow;\lambda_c=\frac{\ln 2}{2}=0.3466 \text{ /year}.
]

Treatment hazard:

[
\lambda_t = HR\cdot \lambda_c = 0.65\times 0.3466 = 0.2253 \text{ /year}.
]

With uniform accrual over (A=2) years and administrative end at (T=A+F=3) years, a subject enrolled at time (u\in[0,A]) is followed for ((T-u)) years. The **average** event probability by study end is:

[
\bar{p}(\lambda)
=1-\frac{1}{A\lambda}\left(e^{-\lambda (T-A)}-e^{-\lambda T}\right)
=1-\frac{1}{2\lambda}\left(e^{-\lambda\cdot 1}-e^{-\lambda\cdot 3}\right).
]

Plugging in:

* Control: (\bar p_c \approx 0.4899)
* Treatment: (\bar p_t \approx 0.3573)

Overall (1:1 randomization):

[
\bar p_{\text{overall}}=\frac{\bar p_c+\bar p_t}{2}\approx \frac{0.4899+0.3573}{2}=0.4236.
]

## 3) Convert events → N

[
N_{\text{total}} = \frac{D}{\bar p_{\text{overall}}}
\approx \frac{169.2}{0.4236}
\approx 399.4
]

So you need **about 400 total participants**, i.e.:

**✅ ~200 patients per arm (total ~400).**

### Notes (what would change this)

* **Dropout/noncompliance**: inflate N by (1/(1-\text{dropout})) approximately (e.g., 10% dropout → ~223/arm).
* If you meant **one-sided** (\alpha=0.05), the event requirement drops a bit (and so would N).
