To test the **linear dose–response trend** across **3 dose levels** in a **3×2 factorial (3 doses × 2 formulations)**, the trend is a **1-df contrast** (numerator df (u=1)). With 6 cells total, the error df is (v = N - 6) under a balanced fixed-effects ANOVA model.

Using Cohen’s (f) for the effect being tested, the usual power setup for the omnibus (F)-test is:

* Noncentrality: (\lambda = f^2 , N)
* Critical value: (F_{1,,N-6;,0.95}) (since (\alpha=0.05))
* Power: (P\big(F_{1,,N-6}(\lambda) > F_{\text{crit}}\big))

With (f = 0.25), (\alpha=0.05), target power (=0.80):

* The **minimum total (N)** that reaches (\ge 80%) power is **(N = 128)**.

Because factorial designs are typically run **balanced across the 6 cells**, the practical balanced choice is:

* (21) per cell (\Rightarrow N=126): power (\approx 0.795) (just under 0.80)
* **(22) per cell (\Rightarrow N=132): power (\approx 0.813)**

✅ **Recommendation (balanced): (N = 132) total (22 per cell).**
✅ **Minimum (if imbalance is acceptable): (N = 128) total.**

*Assumptions: equal allocation across all 6 groups, fixed-effects ANOVA, and the stated (f=0.25) corresponds specifically to the 1-df linear dose-trend effect (averaged over formulation), not the dose×formulation interaction.*
