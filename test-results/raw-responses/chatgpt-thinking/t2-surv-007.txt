We can treat the competing event as **independent censoring** for a **cause-specific Cox / log-rank** power calculation. Then the key driver is the **number of primary events observed**.

## 1) Primary-event count needed (Schoenfeld / log-rank)

With 1:1 allocation, two-sided (\alpha=0.05), power (=0.80), target cause-specific HR (=0.70):

[
D ;=; \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{(\log HR)^2 , p(1-p)}
\quad\text{with }p=0.5
]

* (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96), (z_{1-\beta}=0.842)
* (\log(0.7)=-0.3567)
* (p(1-p)=0.25)

[
D \approx \frac{(1.96+0.842)^2}{(0.3567)^2 \cdot 0.25} \approx 246.8
]

So you need about **247 primary events** total.

## 2) Convert events → sample size (accounting for competing events)

You gave:

* Control **primary** event rate: 30%
* **Competing** event rate: 15% (independent of treatment)

A common interpretation is: **30% would have the primary event if there were no competing events**, and **15% will be removed from risk** by competing events before the primary event can occur. A simple adjustment is:

[
\pi_C \approx 0.30 \times (1-0.15)=0.255
]

Under HR (=0.7), approximate treatment primary-event probability:
[
\pi_T \approx 0.255 \times 0.7=0.1785
]

Average primary-event probability across both arms:
[
\bar\pi = (\pi_C+\pi_T)/2 \approx (0.255+0.1785)/2 = 0.21675
]

Total sample size:
[
N \approx D / \bar\pi \approx 246.8 / 0.21675 \approx 1138.6
]

### ✅ Result (rounded up)

* **Per arm:** (\lceil 1138.6/2\rceil = \mathbf{570})
* **Total:** **1140**

## Important note (if your “30% control event rate” already *includes* competing risks)

If the 30% is the **observed cumulative incidence** of the primary event *despite* competing events (i.e., already “net” of them), then you **should not** multiply by ((1-0.15)). In that case:

* (\pi_C=0.30), (\pi_T\approx 0.21), (\bar\pi\approx 0.255)
* (N \approx 246.8/0.255 \approx 968.6) → **485 per arm** (970 total)

---

### Bottom line

* If 30% is **without** competing events and 15% are competing events that censor people: **~570 per arm**.
* If 30% is **already the primary CIF** in the presence of competing events: **~485 per arm**.

If you tell me which definition your “30% control event rate” refers to (net vs already-in-presence-of-competing), I’ll lock in the single correct number.
