For a standard 2×2 crossover analyzed as a **paired comparison** (i.e., within-subject difference in AUC between formulations), the required sample size is the same as a **one-sample/paired t-test** on the within-subject differences.

### Given

* Expected mean within-subject difference: (\Delta = 50)
* Within-subject SD of the difference: (\sigma_w = 100)
* (\alpha = 0.05) (typically **two-sided** unless you specify one-sided)
* Power (= 0.85) (\Rightarrow \beta = 0.15)

### Approximate normal-based sample size

[
n \approx \left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta}}{\Delta/\sigma_w}\right)^2
]

* (z_{1-\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \approx 1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta} = z_{0.85} \approx 1.036)
* (\Delta/\sigma_w = 50/100 = 0.5)

So:
[
n \approx \left(\frac{1.96 + 1.036}{0.5}\right)^2
= \left(\frac{2.996}{0.5}\right)^2
= (5.992)^2
\approx 35.9
]

### Result

**You need about (\boxed{36}) subjects total** (each subject receives both formulations) to achieve **85% power at (\alpha=0.05)** (two-sided), under the paired-difference assumption.

*Practical note:* If you expect dropouts, inflate: e.g., 10% dropout → (36/0.9 \approx 40) subjects.
