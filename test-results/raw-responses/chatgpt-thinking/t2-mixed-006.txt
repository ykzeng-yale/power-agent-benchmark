Assume a standard linear mixed model for a continuous outcome with **fixed effects** for `time`, `group`, and the **group×time interaction** (the slope difference you care about), plus **random intercept and random slope** per subject:

[
y_{ij}=\beta_0+\beta_1 t_{j}+\beta_2 G_i+\beta_3 (G_i t_j) + b_{0i}+b_{1i} t_j+\varepsilon_{ij},
]
with (t_j=0,1,\dots,7), (G_i\in{0,1}),
[
(b_{0i},b_{1i}) \sim N!\left(0,\begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{b0}^2&0\0&\sigma_{b1}^2\end{bmatrix}\right),\quad
\varepsilon_{ij}\sim N(0,\sigma_e^2),
]
and you gave (\sigma_{b0}=1.0,\ \sigma_{b1}=0.3,\ \sigma_e=1.0). (I’m also assuming **zero intercept–slope correlation** since none was provided, balanced data, and no missingness.)

### Step 1: Get the SE of the group×time slope difference

With 8 equally spaced time points, the within-subject marginal covariance is
[
\Sigma = ZGZ^\top + \sigma_e^2 I,\quad Z=[\mathbf{1},, t].
]

For this balanced 2-group design, the GLS information for the fixed effects scales linearly with (n) per group, so:

[
\mathrm{Var}(\hat\beta_3) = \frac{c}{n},
]

and plugging in your variance components and times (0\ldots7) gives

[
c \approx 0.22762 \quad\Rightarrow\quad
SE(\hat\beta_3)=\sqrt{\frac{0.22762}{n}}.
]

### Step 2: Power for detecting (\Delta=\beta_3=0.1)

Noncentrality (Wald / large-sample t) is:
[
\lambda = \frac{\Delta}{SE} = \frac{0.1}{\sqrt{0.22762/n}}.
]

Using a two-sided (\alpha=0.05) test (critical value (\approx 1.96), or a t with df (\approx 2n-4) — essentially the same here), the smallest (n) that reaches 80% power is:

**✅ Minimum (n \approx 180) per group** (total (N \approx 360)).

### Notes (what would change this)

* **Missing visits / dropout** will usually *increase* the needed (n).
* A **negative** intercept–slope correlation (if present) can *help* or *hurt* depending on pattern; since you didn’t specify it, I assumed 0.
* If you plan a **one-sided** test, (n) would drop somewhat.

If you tell me the expected intercept–slope correlation (or if you expect dropout like 15–20%), I can adjust the number quickly.
