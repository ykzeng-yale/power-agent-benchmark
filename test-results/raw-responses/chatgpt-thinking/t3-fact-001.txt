For a balanced **2×2 factorial** with **n per cell**, the **main effect** of one factor compares the average of two cells vs the average of the other two cells:

* Level A=1 mean: ((\bar Y_{11}+\bar Y_{12})/2) uses **2n** subjects total
* Level A=0 mean: ((\bar Y_{01}+\bar Y_{02})/2) uses **2n** subjects total

So the main-effect test is essentially a **two-sample comparison with 2n per level**, and the variance works out to:
[
SE(\text{main effect})=\sigma\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}}
]
(i.e., it’s *more efficient* than a simple two-arm trial with n per arm).

Using the usual normal-approximation sample size for a two-sided test:
[
n_{\text{2-arm per group}}=\frac{2,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{d^2}
]
With (\alpha=0.05\Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96), (1-\beta=0.80\Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=0.842), (d=0.4):
[
n_{\text{2-arm per group}}=\frac{2(1.96+0.842)^2}{0.4^2}
=\frac{2(2.802)^2}{0.16}
\approx \frac{15.70}{0.16}\approx 98.1
]
So a standard two-arm trial would need about **99 per group**.

In a 2×2 factorial, each main-effect level has **2n** subjects, so:
[
2n \approx 99 ;\Rightarrow; n \approx 49.5
]

✅ **Answer: 50 subjects per cell** (balanced).
That implies **total N = 4×50 = 200**.

*(Assumes equal cell sizes, main-effect model with no interaction inflation, and a two-sided α=0.05 as implied by “per-comparison α=0.05.” If you meant one-sided, the number would be smaller.)*
