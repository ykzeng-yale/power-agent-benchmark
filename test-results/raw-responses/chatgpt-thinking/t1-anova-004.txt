For a **one-way ANOVA (omnibus F-test)** with **3 equal-size groups**, the key is Cohen’s **(f)**:

### 1) Compute the effect size (f)

Expected mean LDL reductions (mg/dL):
(\mu = (10,;20,;25)) with common SD (\sigma = 20).

Grand mean:
[
\bar{\mu}=\frac{10+20+25}{3}=18.333
]

Between-group (weighted) variance of means (equal weights (1/3)):
[
\frac{(10-18.333)^2+(20-18.333)^2+(25-18.333)^2}{3}
= \frac{69.444+2.778+44.444}{3}=38.889
]

So
[
f=\sqrt{\frac{38.889}{20^2}}=\sqrt{\frac{38.889}{400}} \approx 0.312
]

### 2) Solve for (n) per group (ANOVA, (\alpha=0.05), power (=0.80), (k=3))

Using the noncentral F power calculation for one-way ANOVA with (f\approx 0.312) gives:

* **(n \approx 102.2) per group**, so round up to ensure ≥80% power:

✅ **103 participants per diet group**
✅ **Total (N = 309)**

**Note:** This is for the **overall ANOVA test** (“are any of the three means different?”). If you instead need **specific pairwise comparisons** (e.g., Diet 2 vs Diet 3) with multiplicity correction (Tukey/Bonferroni), you’ll generally need a larger (n).
