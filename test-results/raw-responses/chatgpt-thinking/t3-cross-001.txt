For a standard **2×2 crossover** (sequences AB/BA) with a continuous outcome, the treatment effect is essentially estimated from **within-subject differences**, so the key variance reduction comes from the within-subject correlation ( \rho ).

### 1) Convert your “between-subject” effect size to the paired-difference scale

If your standardized effect size is
[
d=\frac{\Delta}{\sigma}=0.5
]
(where (\sigma) is the **total** SD of a single measurement), then the SD of a within-subject treatment difference is
[
\sigma_D=\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(Y_A-Y_B)}=\sqrt{2\sigma^2(1-\rho)}=\sigma\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}.
]
So the effective (paired) standardized effect is
[
d_{\text{paired}}=\frac{\Delta}{\sigma_D}=\frac{d}{\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}}.
]
With (\rho=0.7):
[
\sqrt{2(1-0.7)}=\sqrt{0.6}=0.7746,\quad
d_{\text{paired}}=\frac{0.5}{0.7746}=0.6455.
]

### 2) Paired t-test sample size (normal approximation)

For two-sided (\alpha=0.05) and power (1-\beta=0.80):
[
n=\left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{d_{\text{paired}}}\right)^2
]
[
z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96,\quad z_{1-\beta}=0.84,\quad z\text{-sum}=2.80
]
[
n=\left(\frac{2.80}{0.6455}\right)^2=18.84 ;\Rightarrow; 19 \text{ subjects}.
]

### 3) Round for balanced sequences

A 2×2 crossover typically uses **equal numbers in AB and BA**, so round up to an even number:

✅ **Total required: 20 subjects** (≈ **10 per sequence**) for **80% power** at **α = 0.05**.

*Assumes no dropout and that the simple crossover analysis is well-approximated by a paired-difference test (no major period/carryover issues).*
