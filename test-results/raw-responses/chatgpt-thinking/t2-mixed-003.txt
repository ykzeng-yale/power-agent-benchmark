A handy approximation for **repeated monthly measurements with compound symmetry (ICC = ρ)** is to treat each subject as contributing an **average of m correlated outcomes**. The subject-level mean has variance reduced by the factor
[
\text{Var}(\bar Y)=\sigma^2\frac{1+(m-1)\rho}{m}
]
So a treatment effect expressed as a **single-visit standardized mean difference** (d) becomes an **effective** effect size for the mean over visits:
[
d_{\text{eff}} ;=; d \sqrt{\frac{m}{1+(m-1)\rho}}
]

### Step 1: Compute the effective effect size

Monthly visits over **6 months** → take **m = 6** repeated outcomes.

With (d=0.35), (\rho=0.4):
[
d_{\text{eff}} = 0.35\sqrt{\frac{6}{1+5(0.4)}}
= 0.35\sqrt{\frac{6}{3}}
= 0.35\sqrt{2}
\approx 0.35(1.414)
\approx 0.495
]

### Step 2: Two-sample size formula using (d_{\text{eff}})

For **90% power** and **two-sided (\alpha=0.05)**:

* (z_{1-\alpha/2}=1.96)
* (z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.90}=1.2816)

[
n_{\text{per arm}}
= \frac{2,(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta})^2}{d_{\text{eff}}^2}
= \frac{2,(1.96+1.2816)^2}{0.495^2}
]

Compute:

* (1.96+1.2816=3.2416)
* ((3.2416)^2 \approx 10.512)
* (2\times 10.512 = 21.024)
* (0.495^2 \approx 0.245)

[
n_{\text{per arm}} \approx \frac{21.024}{0.245} \approx 85.8 \Rightarrow \boxed{86 \text{ per arm}}
]

## Answer

**≈ 86 subjects per arm** (about **172 total**) for 90% power at (\alpha=0.05) (two-sided), assuming **6 repeated monthly outcomes** and **ICC = 0.4**.

### Practical note (almost always needed)

If you expect dropout/missed visits, inflate:

* 10% loss → (86/0.90 \approx 96) per arm
* 15% loss → (86/0.85 \approx 102) per arm

If you tell me whether the 6 months includes a **baseline** measurement in the primary contrast (and your expected missingness rate), I can give the exact inflation you’d use for your planned analysis (MMRM vs mean-over-time vs slope).
