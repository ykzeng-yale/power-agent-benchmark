For a Cox proportional hazards model with a **single continuous predictor**, a common planning approximation is the **Schoenfeld/Freedman events formula**:

[
D ;=; \frac{\left(z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}\right)^2}{\left(\log(HR)\right)^2 , \mathrm{Var}(X)}
]

* (D) = number of **events** needed
* Here the HR is **per 1 SD increase**, so if you truly standardize the biomarker, (\mathrm{Var}(X)=1).
* (\alpha=0.05) two-sided (\Rightarrow z_{1-\alpha/2}=z_{0.975}=1.96)
* Power (=0.80) (\Rightarrow z_{1-\beta}=z_{0.80}=0.842)
* (HR=1.3 \Rightarrow \log(HR)=\log(1.3)=0.262)

### 1) Events needed

[
D=\frac{(1.96+0.842)^2}{(0.262)^2}
=\frac{(2.802)^2}{0.0688}
=\frac{7.85}{0.0688}
\approx 114 \text{ events}
]

### 2) Convert events to total sample size

If about **25%** experience the event during the study, then (D \approx 0.25N), so:

[
N=\frac{D}{0.25}=\frac{114}{0.25}=456
]

### Answer

You need **about 456 patients total** (round up in practice: **~460**), to achieve **80% power** at **two-sided (\alpha=0.05)** to detect **HR = 1.3 per SD**.

**Assumptions (important):** proportional hazards holds, the biomarker effect is log-linear, the “25% event” rate is accurate (including loss to follow-up/censoring), and you’re powering for the biomarker’s coefficient in a Cox model (additional covariates or measurement error can increase required (N)).
